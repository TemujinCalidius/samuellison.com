			 <p>Finished watching The Social Dilemma. Not sure why I never watched it before or heard of it until today? Definitely opens the mind and reminds me why I removed mainstream social media from my life and #DeGoogled my phone bit by bit, removing one needle at a time of the intravenous drip of the dopamine drugs that are each app on the phone, demanding our attention.</p>

			 <p>Here are the photos of the PC. The old setup had the large coolermaster fan which was more than 15 years of age now. 
The new setup is a Corsair iCue CPU Water Cooler Radiator. Still playing around with lighting within linux though.</p>

			 <p>I watched the #Bandersnatch episode of #BlackMirror in its entirety with each ending. Loved it, highly recommend watching it. Interesting concept. The idea of every single choice we make in life, diverging into another alternate reality that leads to your end, however that end is written to be.</p>

<p>In the recap, I talk about all of last week, including my line of work, #NightShift&rsquo;s, the new #BlackMirror season, #AISlop and hallucinations and John Carpenter&rsquo;s 1988 movie, They Live!</p>

<p>Looking at the whole week, I can already see that my routine was really put out of whack due to #NightShift. I don&rsquo;t know if I am just making excuses up, but it really does feel that way. I was not able to get my sleep pattern right, mostly breaking my 6 to 8 hour sleep period into two cycles. One perhaps within an hour of getting home from work, trying to sleep for 3 to 4 hours, and then waking up for a couple of hours and getting another 2 to 3 hours at the end of the day prior to heading off to work.</p>
<p>During my period of time awake, I really did not feel like doing my daily 30 minutes of skipping, reading, or meditating. I really should have pushed more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say now, at the end of the week and looking back at the daily journal entries - it was a daily mental push to give myself excuses to do other things with my time.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-for-work">What I do for work</h2>
<p>Not sure I would call it work, as I actually do love my job. I&rsquo;m not sure the English language has any appropriate words for it? If you can help me out here, let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>The only reason I am delving more into this area of my life is because I happened to have discussions with someone in comments of my #thoughts posts on the #fediverse and answering a few questions throughout.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m a police officer where I live, and I really enjoy helping people out when they need it most. I know a lot of us get jaded, joining a dream job only to find the reality of it is not what you think - but it really does take a certain mentality to look at the profession from different angles and to shift your focus from <em>crime centric</em> to <em>victim centric</em> and focusing on helping out the victim, communicating with the victim throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>We are trained when going to a job to focus on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender. A lot of us get stuck in tunnel vision and want the fun stuff, chasing the offender and missing all the initial actions necessary for an investigation to be successful at court. And even more so, a lot of us forget in all of that, about the victim. Focusing only on the desired outcome with the offender.</p>
<p>In the end, that leads to burnout. As this job has tonnes of paperwork involved (at least in Victoria). Focusing on the outcome of the offender only to get a result at court that is essentially a slap on the wrist brings you down - and then, because you never focused on the victim - the victim is wondering what&rsquo;s happened since police arrived - did police do nothing? You as a member now have no rapport with the victim.</p>
<p>If you keep yourself focused on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender, not just at the initial job, but throughout the whole process, you are more likely to enjoy the full process, as is the victim going to understand the process by being spoken to like a human being, remembered and guided throughout. While the outcome at court may be the same result - your mind has been on helping a member of the community understand the process and know the likely outcome. This leads to a member of the community who understands the process we go through, understands the law system a little more, and is more likely to speak up to MP&rsquo;s or within the community about our law system to make desired changes.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is one method I have come to enjoy my line of work in the mountain of paperwork and lack of time to do it.</p>
<p>Another method I have come to keep enjoying it, is #compartmentalising and using my daily journal keeping, and my blogging on my own domain name. Gone are the days of sitting on social media, scrolling an endless feed of algorithmically curated content to drain my stream of consciousness and just <em>consume</em>.</p>
<h2 id="black-mirror">Black Mirror</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another method I kept myself sane during what time I had awake after night shift was to delve into the #BlackMIrror series. Season 7 was released, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist digging in, as I really enjoy this series as someone that doesn&rsquo;t actually watch TV anymore or go down the #YouTube rabbit holes and such.</p>
<p>Season 7 was really well done. I enjoyed every episode in it. I initially thought it would be like Season 6 and out of touch with the rest of the seasons, but this season did not disappoint in any way.</p>
<p>Looking at the world from different aspects of <em>what could</em> be with today&rsquo;s technology, or soon to have technology with a bit of a satanical twist to them really makes for an interesting watch.</p>
<p>The first episode actually had me on a downer! And above I was saying keep myself sane by watching this season? Episode 1 was a drainer and <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/14/043923.html">I thought I&rsquo;d need a psych</a> to reground myself into reality!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into any more detail about it, but you really should take the time out to watch them if you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="ai--llms">AI / LLM&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>Speaking of Black Mirror and technology - this week I felt that the LLM&rsquo;s I had been using for discussions and troubleshooting felt off. #GPT and #DeepSeek were hallucinating information a lot more and spitting out false information to me, leading me down tracks of nonsense.</p>
<p>I was trying to troubleshoot and looking into content management systems that had built in #AcivityPub backends for my website.</p>
<p>Currently, I use micro.blog to host my website, and rely on its backend that enables me to follow people on the fediverse and comment/reply to their content and have discussions. It also enables my posts on my blog to appear on the fediverse and for any replies to end up on my website as well.</p>
<p>Micro.blog allows for the exporting of all posts and what not, which is great! But if I wanted to self-host, as well as keep my fediverse identity (@samuel@samuellison.com) I would also need a system that has an ActivityPub backend that is not just a platform with no ability to customise into a full website like what you are reading from now. I can use Mastodon, Pixelfed, GoToSocial, WriteFreely etc, but none of those offer what I need.</p>
<p>The LLM&rsquo;s were spitting out so much false information that I was down a rabbit hole for 2 hours before I realised this was all nonsense. The LLM&rsquo;s finally admitted that they were wrong when pressed, and that their information was based on &ldquo;<em>theoretical features</em>&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t yet exist!</p>
<p>Could it be that the #AISlop that is appearing more and more on the internet is causing #AI to become more useless when it comes to providing us with information?</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of content these days, including articles, stories, news, videos - are all AI generated by people that are prompting AI to write it. This makes AI gather the information it needs from the internet, assess, and then spit out the work for you.</p>
<p>Then, the next person does the same. AI repeats, gathers its information from itself (from AI generated content already on the web now - repeat) and spits out even more useless information.</p>
<p>Then, you have companies like #CloudFlare, a content delivery network, that attempts to protect its clientele by creating <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/">sophisticated <em>mazes</em></a> where AI is lead down these rabbit holes of information it thinks it is obtaining from legitimate sources, which is actually in itself being created on the fly by other AI technology and feeding the requesting AI/LLM with misinformation.</p>
<p>Have you noticed this starting to happen?</p>
<p>I personally think it&rsquo;s a good thing. I mean, LLM&rsquo;s have been stealing the work of artists and writers now for some time. Why are we going in the direction of AI replacing all our jobs, instead of making AI useful? Where are these AI that can come do my washing, my dishes, my gardening and other duties around the household to enable me to have more free time to do what I enjoy to do during my spare time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need my job replaced by AI, I&rsquo;m sure none of you do. All this talk of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o"><em>universal basic income</em></a> and the likes. What will we do with our time, if what we enjoy to do is taken by AI? I hope not Episode 2, Season 1 of Black Mirror - <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2089049/">Fifteen Million Merits</a>!</p>
<h2 id="family-visiting">Family Visiting</h2>
<p>I had family visiting from Brisbane during my time doing night shifts. Means I missed out on a lot of opportune family time with members of the family I don&rsquo;t generally get to see on a regular basis, which is a shame. But we did still get a few things done as family where I got to be involved. Including celebrating my father in laws 70th birthday with some wonderful food at #BoardWalkPizzeria in #CarolineSprings.</p>
<p>Also got to celebrate an Easter dinner with the family and cousins and all the kids. We guys played a few board games, including #munchkins and #Catan! My cousin made some beautiful #pizza which we all enjoyed very much!</p>
<h2 id="john-carpenters-they-live">John Carpenter&rsquo;s: They Live</h2>
<p>Saying that I generally don&rsquo;t watch movies is somewhat of a lie. After seeing a post by <a href="https://defcon.social/@n1ghtw1re">@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social</a> suggesting to go watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/">They Live</a> by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/">John Carpenter</a> I went and did just that. I <em>can</em> be swayed into watching movies by those I choose to follow and consume information from - I suppose!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Actually quite a good movie indeed! Made in 1988 and having a Black Mirror kind of vibe where humanity has actually been taken over by an alien race, and we are stuck in this illusionary hypnotised state of consuming information and complying.</p>
<p>Actually there&rsquo;s a line in this movie which is featured in the Duke Nukem games, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I&rsquo;m all outta gum&rdquo;, vs the original movie quote, &ldquo;I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass&hellip; and I&rsquo;m all outta bubblegum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actually, the game was somewhat inspired by this movie. Not only in the line, but the hog police (aliens), the whole look of Duke Nukem and more!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you read my blurb of consciousness recapping on my week, good on you, and thank you. I hope that you enjoyed it and I look forward to making another recap next week to reflect on and look back to in the future!</p>

			 <p>Something I have been enjoying about the #Fediverse is the ability to follow domains instead of just social accounts. Some creators have both the domain with news articles and a dedicated social network account on things like #Mastodon. But these tend to sometimes get too much, like #GrapheneOS lately. I can keep updated with actual product news by following their domain, and not get all the other stuff that is not relevant to me.</p>

			 <p>Watched Episode 5 of #BlackMirror Season 7. Sad really, actually got a tear out of me. The things we humans do in life and focus on selfish thoughts and don&rsquo;t blink an eye at or think about what the other persons perspective may be, their emotions and own life experience.</p>
<p>5/6 of the Episodes I have enjoyed greatly. For anyone to think they are not original&hellip; not sure what their perspective is on that. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind knowing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want people to read what I write here. I want (hope) to be a familiar face in feed readers. I want to be linked to. The internet is a network and I want to be part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think every blogger goes through this. Webmentions are handy, but now there are ActivityPub integrations that work well and allow your thoughts to be read by followers on the #fediverse directly. #IndieMicroblogging is <a href="https://book.micro.blog/">real</a>.</p>

Isn&rsquo;t that why a lot of coders in silicon valley are into the #microdosing these days? The world of #fungi is an interesting one. Streaming direct from the #muse.</p>

<p>Basically, why don&rsquo;t I do a recap that goes through what I accomplished for the week based on a lot of the daily notes I made and go into more detail, since larger long-form content allows for more characters and space to just let it all out and stretch?</p>
<h2 id="onto-the-recap">Onto the Recap!</h2>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t feel I ticked off enough of my <em>daily tasks</em> such as regular skipping/jump-roping, reading, meditating and what not, I feel like I did have a busy week and a lot of debriefing to do with myself. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here and more that I will need to write about, now that I come to think of it.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-i-did">Some things I did</h2>
<h3 id="phillip-island">Phillip Island</h3>
<p>Just at the end of last week, the family and I took off to #PhillipIsland and stayed by a beach house. In one of my notes, I state that I should write more of an article about it, yet, I have not yet done so. I need to add this to my list of things to do!</p>
<p>I did at least make a video of it for the family to see, but nothing public about it to discuss where we went, what it was like out there, what did we see?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Stay-tuned, as I may update this post later when I make the journal entry about our trip as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="an-unsuspected-death">An unsuspected death</h3>
<p>Sometimes life throws you curve-balls, and unfortunately we recently had one of those.</p>
<p>My eldest daughter has been taking #guitar lessons for a while and had this really great elderly teacher who seemed so happy, so healthy. Until one day, he would try to speak, yet no words come out.</p>
<p>The teacher ended up in hospital for a few days. We all assumed something like #Apraxia or something similar that affected the brain and his ability to form words.</p>
<p>In actuality, it was a #melanoma in the chest, a #cancer, that had already taken over and it was too late. The teacher was given a week to live from that diagnosis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did not get to take my daughter to visit the teacher to say her goodbyes, as it was already too late and coma had set in and it would not have been appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="new-ups">New UPS</h3>
<p>I purchased a new #UPS for our #NAS due to power surges happening during the week as well. This should greatly reduce the risk of permanent damage due to surges on the NAS, modem and switches. I&rsquo;ve also set the NAS up to auto shut down when power goes out and the NAS uses battery backup.</p>
<h3 id="vibe-coding---the-new-buzz-word-out-there">Vibe Coding - The new Buzz Word out there.</h3>
<p>I did a little bit of #VibeCoding in #OpenSimulator and worked a little more on #SurvivorCore. Just added some &ldquo;consumable&rdquo; scripts to increase or decrease any survival stats in the game.</p>
<h3 id="kids-homework">Kids Homework</h3>
<p>I found out that my youngest daughter had not been doing her homework properly as she&rsquo;s been more focused on wanting to play #Roblox on grandma&rsquo;s iPad upstairs while her older sister would play on the XBOX.</p>
<p>I went and put some restrictions on the internet to try prevent them playing while I am at work straight after school, and try to get them to focus on doing their chores and homework prior to any games.</p>
<p>Because the kids enjoy their iPads as much as I enjoy my #Linux computing - I&rsquo;ve encouraged them to take photos of their homework and tutoring and send to my mother who does their tutoring, to show the completed work and get daily feedback via video calls and what not.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-job-new-opportunities">A New Job, New Opportunities</h3>
<p>I caught up with an old friend prior to him having to fly to #Canberra for his new job. Was great to catch up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be gone for 12 to 15 weeks for the training before being brought back here to #Melbourne to do the role he applied for and was a successful applicant for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great when you see friends achieve a goal they had set and get into a dream job they had been trying at for years.</p>
<p>There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, somewhere out there. You just gotta find it.</p>
<h3 id="hiking---werribee-gorge">Hiking - Werribee Gorge</h3>
<p>I went for a #hike to #WerribeeGorge with the girls and this was a lot of fun. I should make a #CaptainsLog post about this as well. Stay tuned for that one as I will make another journal entry there and update this article to point to it to prove it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud of my kids for accomplishing this one as it was challenging enough for such youngins.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian-a-new-tool">Obsidian, a new tool</h3>
<p>I also did a lot of playing around on #Obsidian to improve on my #journal workflow. I used it for this article, and am using it now for all my #microblog entries and notes.</p>
<p>It allows me to organise all my thoughts in a map, to publish straight to my website and to the #fediverse as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found I&rsquo;ve been more productive using this tool - though, maybe that&rsquo;s just a feeling? Is writing your thoughts and journal considered a form of procrastination in and of itself? We will see when I look back in a few months, or years, won&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>I get to keep short notes within a larger daily entry. I can look back at the whole week and then make a post like this one to reflect on the whole week - see where I can improve on and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>I can also use it as a link aggregator in my short micro entries. Posting a link of a website I looked at and found interesting, and briefly talk about the subject matter. If I find I am talking about a certain #hashtag over and over, I can see an obvious trend in my current interests and choose to post in more detail about it.</p>
<h2 id="on-to-next-week">On to Next Week</h2>
<p>Anyway, I have more things to do. This was my first weekly recap. I plan to do more - but alas, there&rsquo;s only so much time in a day!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s a little hard to plan for the coming week, due to doing #NightShift at work. Makes it difficult to gather the energy to actually <strong>do</strong> things productively. I know there&rsquo;s a few friend and family dinners planned which I will tick boxes off there and have some social fun. This is actually one of the reasons I dislike working the #graveyard shift. Throws life way out of wack!</p>

Will feel it through the day today, but hopefully get some good shut eye before the next one.</p>
<p>I need to do a review on last weeks journaling and see where I have done well and where I can improve. Maybe write a weekly style review or recap like I have seen some other bloggers do.</p>

<p>Last month, I went for a final hike in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge">Lerderderg Gorge</a> basically, at the end of summer. And unfortunately, most of the Lerderderg Gorge hiking trails will be closed over Autumn due to planned burning.</p>
<p>These are done, essentially, to keep us, and the surrounds safe here in Australia by minimising the damage a bush fire causes in the more dangerous and drier months.</p>
<p>So for now, Lerderderg will unfortunately not be on my list of locations for fungi photography until a little later in the year. Hopefully I will be able to find some sturdier species coming into winter though!</p>
<h2 id="where-is-lerderderg">Where is Lerderderg?</h2>
<p>The Lerderderg State park is just north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh">Bacchus Marsh</a> in Victoria, Australia. It is a gorge that has been carved out of the rugged landscape by the Lerderderg River.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In early 1851, the area was reputed to be a hot spot for gold mining, and At its peak saw thousands of diggers arrive looking for the lucrative mineral.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hiking this beautiful location, you can check out the AllTrails entry here: <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit">https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit</a></p>
<h2 id="the-adventure">The Adventure</h2>
<p>In this section of the log, I am going to go on and on about my last hike around the Lerderderg Circuit Track. But, if you want to see and hear it first hand instead of read, you can do so by watching this 3.5 hour video of my hike below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h3>
<p>I set off early in the morning, but due to the weather known to be cooler, I didn&rsquo;t start my hike in the cool or the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>It was early morning and I strapped my <a href="https://www.dji.com/au/osmo-action-5-pro">DJI Action</a> onto my chest to get some Point of View (POV) footage of the entire hike to make a video out of it for those interested. That should be embedded for you above for you to watch. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, let me know in the comments and I will embed from an alternative source!</p>
<p>I brought a <a href="https://rode.com/en/microphones/on-camera/videomic-pro">R0DE VideoMic Pro</a> Microphone as well, linked up with <a href="https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelesspro">Rode Wireless Pro&rsquo;s</a> to capture any sounds with some more detail, as that&rsquo;s something I would also like to increase my skills in, and then I set off down the beautiful trail.</p>
<p>At this time of the year, there&rsquo;s usually no flowing water along the river, so the river crossings are easier and you can keep your feet dry, but I will say that having flowing water along a majority of the hike sets a beautiful sound and scenery to enjoy alongside you - so I will be returning here with flowing water with this new equipment. My first attempt at recording this location was using my <a href="https://makertube.net/w/pySqnnSGD6dAryQ3fcrHNW">mobile phone</a> which while the quality was high, it doesn&rsquo;t leave enough room for editing the colours just right to my own liking.</p>
<p>Here are a few sound recordings that I took along the hike. I hope that you enjoy listening to them as much as I enjoyed the recording of them.</p>

<h3 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h3>
<p>This time around, I felt much fitter than my first attempt. Yes, it was cooler, and that would have helped some, but I also felt my cardiovascular and my fitness in general was up to standard for this hike.</p>
<p>There are a couple scrambles which actually require you to use your hands to hold onto the rocks to help yourself up, but nothing too difficult. You just need to be a little careful if you are like me and like to <a href="https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/">ruck</a> your pack. Basically, I enjoy having a 15kg or more backpack on. Not only due to my requirement for photography equipment, but <a href="https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/">rucking</a> is also a form of exercise and increases my strength needs when hiking, especially when going up and really getting into those leg muscles.</p>
<p>Going down means I have to go slower, and trekking poles are really a necessity, as falls are more likely with a heavier backpack when not careful of the extra weight.</p>
<p>Even climbing sometimes, it requires you to activate your core muscles more and take notice of your centre of gravity point, as leaning back a little too much, you&rsquo;ll find that you struggle to keep a balance!</p>
<p>I wish I already had a heart rate monitor and my handheld GPS tracker, as I would like to wear a strap heart rate monitor that tracks my heart rate along the hike, that I can then overlay across the whole video of the hike. That way, you can get a feel of how easy or how difficult a portion of what I am doing might be, based on my own fitness levels - but I am no athlete!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A smart watch with built in heart rate wont do it for me. New ones aren&rsquo;t what they use to be, in my opinion, and their privacy policies are all as bad as each other, require proprietary software to read data from which these companies data mine you for. I will give what data I want to publish thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-top">The Top</h3>
<p>At the top of the mountain, I was approximately 440 or 450m above sea level. I wouldn&rsquo;t be grading the difficulty of a hike or climb based on how high up a mountain is though. The difficulty is determined by the incline, or, steepness of the hike up, whether it requires a lot of scrambling and how long the steep inclinations go for.</p>
<p>You could have a 2,000m mountain with a slight slope that you walk for an hour easily, vs a 100m mountain that has a 50 degree incline that will give you more of a challenge. It&rsquo;s like a slow jog vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">HIIT</a> training.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain, I took the opportunity to enjoy a small break - re-energised myself with some food and prepared myself for the downward section of the mountain.</p>
<h2 id="the-easy-part">The Easy Part</h2>
<p>The walk down was enjoyable. Heart rate back to normal, the sweat on my back cooling me down as the sun rose higher into the skies.</p>
<p>I made it back in time to get home, have a shower and pick up the girls from school.</p>
<p>The next fun part of the whole hike was to edit all the footage I took of my video and audio and upload it to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/samuellison">ko-fi</a> account for subscribers to download for free if they wish it (or pay what they like).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear about your adventures!</p>

			 <p>My mother told me that my daughter is having difficulty with her homework and tutoring as she has an addiction to the iPad and in particular #Roblox.</p>
<p>After some discussion, I have put some restrictions on the XBOX to prevent both the girls from playing anything on it from 3pm to 6pm after school if I am not at home, as it seems that when both my wife and I are at work, the kids will rush to get to Grandmas' iPAD and run upstairs to the XBOX to play Roblox together.</p>

			 <p>You guys might notice me replying with a different fediverse account <a href="https://micro.blog/samuel@samuellison.com">@samuel@samuellison.com</a> - I am slowly using that account to reply from using Micro.Blog as it syndicates better with my website at <a href="http://www.samuellison.com">www.samuellison.com</a> and shows replies on my own #indieweb website. My Mastodon Instance will probably become where I #POSSE to for backups, or I may end up not requiring it down the track at all.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t agree more. It&rsquo;s writers like these, as well as <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and so forth that got me re-focused on the indieweb and creating my own home again on the internet. I will admit, loading up my website and reading my blog and &ldquo;microblog&rdquo; posts and its replies coming in from people reading from the website or other platforms thanks to syndication and webmentions, just feels so nice and cozy.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been procrastinating too much, so I set myself out to #journal my daily tasks by setting a &ldquo;To-Do&rdquo; and a spot to journal about what I have accomplished for the day and anything I wish to add to the next days planning.
I&rsquo;m going to also try and do this on a weekly/monthly and yearly basis.</p>

			 <p>From my reading about social media platforms growing exponentially, there comes a point where growing a #moderation team is essential. This problem is less common with the #Fediverse with self-hosted small instances. But what about the larger instances? Have any #devs thought about implementing features such as is available in #Discourse. A #trust based moderation system as a community grows? Is that even a feasible thing to do?</p>

<p>Recently, I have had a fascination with wanting to try out hiking in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading about night hiking and what the <a href="https://unlockoutdoors.com/benefits-of-night-hiking/">benefits</a> might be, including being able to stay cooler in the summer heat, experiencing the fascinating sounds of the nocturnal wildlife, and seeing the night sky up above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There’s something magical about hiking in nature at night. You just can&rsquo;t replicate the sights and the sounds of a nightime hike in the daytime. It&rsquo;s a fantastic way to reflect after a frantically busy day.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve also been looking into the various <a href="https://flyfreshflight.com/is-hiking-at-night-dangerous/">dangers</a> that come along with hiking at night too. In Australia (at least in Victoria), we don&rsquo;t have predatorial animals that are interested in humans, so the most common dangers are going to do with the lack of visibility, and these include your poor visibility, which increases your risk of getting lost and increases your risk of having trips and falls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It’s also easier to get lost when you’re hiking at night. The lack of light can make it difficult to see landmarks, and you may not be able to see the trail as well. If you do get lost, it’s important to stay calm and retrace your steps. If you’re unable to find your way back, call for help.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Well, on Monday the 10th of March 2025, I finally got to experience hiking in the darkness!</p>
<p>My wife and I checked our weather app and it was going to be a scorcher. That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky.</p>
<p>Initially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>
<p>So there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at <a href="https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park">Werribee Gorge</a>, about to do the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track">Long and Short Circuit Track combined</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark.</p>
<p>While I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.</p>
<p>The torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you&rsquo;d like to check out the torch, it&rsquo;s a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on <a href="https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam.</p>
<p>I also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet!<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Another thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there&rsquo;s plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.</p>
<h3 id="strange-sounds">Strange Sounds</h3>
<p>While commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that&rsquo;s how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.</p>
<p>I was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don&rsquo;t know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-came-the-next-challenge">And then came the next challenge.</h3>
<p>You see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below.</p>
<p>Putting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.</p>
<h3 id="serene-views--wildlife">Serene Views &amp; Wildlife</h3>
<p>On the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.</p>
<p>As the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system">filtration system</a>, of course), and you&rsquo;re actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it&rsquo;s a much sought after resource!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It&rsquo;s got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn&rsquo;t too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!</p>
<p>We finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Would I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let&rsquo;s see if we can tackle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge">Lerderderg Gorge</a> and I will let you all know how that goes!</p>
<p>And then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below.
What&rsquo;s your experience hiking in the darkness? Have you done it before? Would you do it again? If you haven&rsquo;t done it before, would you consider giving it a go?</p>

Should the family need me urgently? They know my work landline. We survived pre 90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>While I have been a member of both the <a href="https://secondlife.com">SecondLife</a> and <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSimulator</a> platforms for some time, let&rsquo;s say, 16 years on Second Life, and 1 good year on OpenSimulator, it did not actually hit me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a> was already here with us until <a href="https://about.meta.com/">Meta&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wanted to create his own branded &ldquo;<a href="https://about.meta.com/metaverse/">Metaverse</a>&rdquo; to rule them all.</p>
<p>There was talk about Second Life briefly being the answer to the metaverse, but in reality, it does not tick all the boxes (think proprietary, centralized)</p>
<p>And then, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>, and learned about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indieweb</a> and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">Small Web</a> movements, and it became much clearer to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="opensimulator-the-metaverse">OpenSimulator, the Metaverse</h2>
<p>So, why do I consider OpenSimulator to tick all the boxes when it comes to being more along the lines of what the metaverse should truly be?</p>
<p>After being a member of the Fediverse for a few months now and learning about <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-decentralized-social-media/">decentralization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> and all those fancy words, I came to realise that the OpenSimulator platform, which seems from the outside to be just a clone of SecondLife, is actually the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is Free and Open Source Software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>), and secondly, and most importantly, it is completely decentralized. Allowing people to create their worlds (think, rooms) and connect them to existing grids (think, servers).</p>
<p>So, not only can you host your own worlds on an existing grid and create an account and personal identity on that grid (or server), but you also have the ability to do it yourself, host your own grid with as many worlds as you wish, and connect it to what is known as the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">Hypergrid</a>, and still be interconnected between all the different worlds, grids and so forth.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Region</strong> = World, or, Planet</li>
<li><strong>Grid</strong> = Server, or, Universe</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add a planet to someone else&rsquo;s universe, or you can create your own universe with your own rules and connect it, or not, to the Metaverse, or, Multiverse, officially known as the Hypergrid.</p>
<p>And it will always be there, no matter what happens to the rest of the universes (grids) out there.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do?</h2>
<p>I decided to host my own Region (or World) and connect it to the Grid (Universe) known as <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> which allows registered users to connect their own regions to their grid, at no cost (besides of course your own hosting costs).</p>
<p>This means, I used an existing avatar account to make the owner of my region and self-host it!</p>
<p>By default, region sizes are setup in the OpenSimulator configuration as 256x256 meters (which is also the size of regions on Second Life). It&rsquo;s actually possible to run much larger region sizes, or to host multiple regions together and place them next to each other to suits your needs.</p>
<p>In my case, I am running a single region, the size of 4x4 (16) regions. Basically, 1024x1024m in land size, and I can do whatever I like with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently bare though, and here&rsquo;s a screenshot of it in its current state.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on">What am I working on?</h2>
<p>I want to build a world based off of 28 Years Later. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/3iiyYkKXpxk">trailer</a> yet, I highly recommend that you do.</p>
<p>I love the idea of having a city which is going through a Zombie Apocalypse and the player having to fight their way through an infested city by smacking zombie NPCs and gathering resources, until they come across a stranded island that appears to be a safe-haven.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This safe-haven will be a village with roles for people to take on and to live their merry lives on. Roles might include things like farmers, smiths, carpenters and hunters. Hunters would go out back into the city, looking for valuable resources, such as metals, more foods, ammunition and medicines.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A fun survival style game.</p>
<p>How do you accomplish that on the Metaverse? Are you able to code?</p>
<h3 id="yes-you-can-code-on-the-metaverse">Yes, you can code on the Metaverse!</h3>
<p>Not only can you build your world with 3d mesh models and materials, in my case, assets I purchased from the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a> and converted them into usable formats using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a>; but you can code anything your heart desires in OpenSimulator (and yes, in Second Life too).</p>
<p>Both OpenSimulator and Second Life have their own scripting languages.</p>
<p>Second Life uses the <a href="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">Linden Scripting Language (LSL)</a> and OpenSimulator has a highly expanded, yet similar language known as <a href="">OpenSimulator Scripting Language (OSSL)</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of code so you can see how easy it is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>default {
    touch_start(integer num) {
        key player = llDetectedKey(0); // Get the avatar's key
        string playerName = llDetectedName(0); // Get the avatar's name

        // Send registration request to the data server
        llRegionSay(12345, &quot;Register|&quot; + (string)player + &quot;|&quot; + playerName);

        // Notify the player directly
        llSay(0, &quot;Registration request sent, &quot; + playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You can view more of my source that I have been working on within my <a href="https://github.com/TemujinCalidius/SurvivorCore">GitHub Repository</a>!</p>
<p>This is just a registration board that players can click on to register their avatar as a player in the system I am working on, but there&rsquo;s way more to do - such as having a HUD and floating text above avatars that tracks the players current survival stats, such as Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Infection as well as a multitude of other things, such as Inventory slots, Coins/Money and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-one-visit">How does one visit?</h2>
<p>To visit places on the OpenSimulator metaverse, you need a virtual world viewer.
And you need the version that allows connection to multiple grids and not just the default Second Life proprietary grid.</p>
<p>The best browser currently is the <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/">Firestorm</a> viewer.</p>
<p>You will need the OpenSimulator version which you can grab from here: <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/">https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/</a></p>
<p>There is support for Windows, Mac and Linux versions. I am using Linux and it works fine.</p>
<p>You can visit my land and come say hello when I am there, by adding the <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> option to your logins (by clicking on &ldquo;<strong>Click to add more grids</strong>&rdquo;, creating an account through the browsers &ldquo;<strong>Create an Account</strong>&rdquo; link and logging in.</p>
<p>Once you are in, open your world map in the view and search for &ldquo;counterearth&rdquo;. I will probably rename the region later to something that matches the RP game I wish to make and update this article when that is done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not much to see in my world currently, but I endeavour to post more updates on my proceedings and discuss the scripts I have come up with in further articles - so be sure to add this RSS to your reader to keep getting updates on my posts!</p>
<p>I hope that this has also inspired you into looking into the Metaverse and seeing how you could contribute with your coding knowledge to make the experience better for everyone out there! I believe the GitHub repository for OpenSimulator can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/opensim/opensim">https://github.com/opensim/opensim</a> and is coded in the C# language.</p>
<p>Have fun all!</p>

<p>Last night, my family and I attended the <strong>Shen Yun 2025</strong> performance at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre. It was the 6 PM session on Saturday, 15th February 2025, and the venue was packed to capacity. In fact, extra seats had to be released to accommodate the overwhelming demand—a testament to the growing popularity of this incredible show.</p>
<p>This was my fourth time attending Shen Yun, and I can confidently say it gets better every year. The artistry, storytelling, and sheer skill of the performers left me in awe once again. Shen Yun is not just a dance performance; it’s an immersive journey into Chinese traditional culture, told through a series of captivating stories. Each dance is a narrative, often inspired by the principles of <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>—a spiritual practice that emphasises <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the story of &ldquo;Enlightenment,&rdquo; which deeply resonated with me. It followed an army commander grappling with the aftermath of a battle, seeking redemption through spiritual cultivation. The tale was both moving and thought-provoking, reminding me of the challenges we all face in overcoming distractions and attachments in our lives.</p>
<p>Shen Yun also touches on profound themes, including the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China. Since 1999, the practice has been banned under the communist regime, which views large, independent movements as a threat. Some of the stories depicted the harsh realities faced by practitioners, including imprisonment and even organ harvesting—issues that remain under scrutiny on the global stage.</p>
<p>While Shen Yun has faced challenges in Australia, particularly in Victoria, this year’s performance felt like a turning point. The messaging was more subtle, focusing on the dangers of atheism and the importance of staying true to one’s faith or tradition. It was a refreshing approach that seemed to resonate with the audience, regardless of their personal beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="a-journey-through-stories-and-values">A Journey Through Stories and Values</h2>
<p>Shen Yun’s performances are structured as a series of short stories, each with its own unique message and artistic flair. The dances are accompanied by a live orchestra that blends traditional Chinese instruments with Western symphonic elements, creating an unforgettable auditory experience.</p>
<p>One of the standout stories for me was &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo; It begins with an army commander surveying the devastation of a battlefield. Overcome with guilt, he contemplates suicide but is stopped by a Buddhist abbot, who guides him toward spiritual cultivation. The commander renounces his attachments and joins a monastery, where he faces tests of his resolve. From temptations of wealth and power to the distractions of worldly desires, the story mirrors the struggles we all face when trying to meditate or focus on self-improvement.</p>
<p>The commander’s ultimate success in achieving enlightenment was beautifully portrayed, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and inspiration. It’s a story that lingers in your mind, encouraging introspection long after the performance ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-subtle-evolution-of-shen-yun">The Subtle Evolution of Shen Yun</h2>
<p>As a <strong>Falun Dafa practitioner</strong>, I’ve noticed how Shen Yun has evolved over the years. Earlier performances leaned heavily into the spiritual aspects of Falun Dafa, which may have felt overwhelming to some Western audiences. This year, however, the messaging was more balanced. The focus shifted toward universal values and the dangers of losing touch with spirituality, making it more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The show’s ability to convey these messages through art is what makes it so special. It’s not just about promoting Falun Dafa; it’s about encouraging people to reflect on their own values and traditions, whatever they may be. This subtlety was a welcome change and, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-to-explore">A Call to Explore</h2>
<p>If you’ve never experienced Shen Yun, I highly recommend attending when it comes to your city. It’s more than just a performance—it’s an opportunity to connect with timeless values and immerse yourself in a rich cultural tradition. For more information about Shen Yun, visit <a href="https://www.shenyun.com/">https://www.shenyun.com/</a>.</p>
<p>For those curious about <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>, I encourage you to explore it at your own pace. There are no memberships, ceremonies, or obligations—just a chance to learn and grow through the principles of <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>. You can find more information at <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">https://en.falundafa.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Shen Yun 2025 was a night to remember, and I’m already looking forward to next year’s performance. It’s a reminder of the beauty of art, the power of storytelling, and the importance of staying true to our values in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p>Hiking has become a cherished activity for me, and it’s even more special when shared with loved ones. Two days ago, I embarked on a hike with my mother through the <strong>Whipstick Loop Walk</strong>, located in <strong>Blackwood, Victoria</strong>, within the <strong>Wombat State Forest</strong>. This 5.8 km loop trail, which takes about two hours to complete, is a relatively easy and scenic walk, perfect for someone like my mother, who is rediscovering hiking after decades.</p>
<p>The trail is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from ferny rainforests near the river to classic Australian bushland with towering eucalypts. It’s a sensory delight, with the crunch of debris underfoot, the fresh smells of eucalyptus and ferns, and the melodic calls of native birds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-day">Preparing for the Day</h3>
<p>We set out on <strong>Friday, 14th February 2024</strong>, a pleasant summer day with a temperature of 23°C. I picked up my mother at 8:00 am, and we arrived at the trailhead by 9:00 am. The previous day’s light rain had left the trail floor scattered with leaves and twigs, adding to the charm of the walk.</p>
<p>Given my mother’s age (65+) and her recent return to hiking, I carefully chose this trail for its gentle inclines and stable footing. It’s a great option for beginner hikers or those easing back into the activity. You can find more details about the trail on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/whipstick-loop-walk">AllTrails</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wildlife-encounters">Wildlife Encounters</h3>
<p>About halfway through the walk, we were thrilled to spot a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala"><strong>koala</strong></a> perched on a young gum tree. It was munching on leaves and scratching itself—a behaviour I later learned is a way for koalas to spread their scent. Here’s the photo I captured:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Later, as we neared the three-quarter mark of the trail, we were treated to another magical moment. Four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_boobook"><strong>southern boobook owls</strong></a> flew by, and one landed on a branch right in front of us. I managed to snap a photo of it as it turned its head in a near 270-degree spin. These owls are Australia’s smallest and most common owl species. Here’s the image:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-trails-beauty">The Trail’s Beauty</h3>
<p>One of the things I love most about the Whipstick Loop Walk is its variety. The trail transitions from lush rainforest-like areas near the river to classic Australian bushland as you gain elevation. The eucalypts here bear the marks of bushfires and strong winds, creating a dramatic and rugged landscape.</p>
<p>Although it’s summer and not the ideal season for fungi, I couldn’t help but reminisce about my previous visits during autumn. The decomposing logs and damp conditions then bring out stunning mushrooms, perfect for photography. On this trip, I didn’t bring my professional camera, but I did snap some of my favourite fungi photos on past visits. Here’s one of a cluster of red mushrooms I captured with my trusty <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000"><strong>Nikon D7000</strong></a>, a 14-year-old camera that still delivers stunning results:</p>

<p>The hike was a wonderful experience, not just for the natural beauty but for the time spent with my mother. She worked up a sweat by the end, but the cool forest temperatures (ranging from 14°C to 19°C) kept the exertion manageable. It’s heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and I’m grateful for these moments we share.</p>
<p>I plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.</p>

			 <p>Wow, I did not realise that #tracking was that complex. Data brokers know your every move! Be careful how many apps, and what apps, you allow on your phone.</p>
<p>I am glad I made the move to #GrapheneOS, which started my progress of removing as many apps as possible from my phone. Dumb it down! THen work on the PC!</p>

With a background in software development and a passion for reviving the personal blogging culture, Manton has crafted <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> since its inception through a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing" title="Micro.Blog Kickstarter Campaign">Kickstarter</a> campaign in 2017.

</ul>
<h2 id="indieweb-practices"><strong>IndieWeb Practices:</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> actively incorporates several <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own Your Content:</strong> Users are encouraged to use their own domain names. The service supports mapping your personal domain to your <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> account, ensuring you maintain control over your digital identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere):</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> facilitates posting from your own site and syndicating to various platforms like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app" title="BlueSky">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, and others, automatically, thereby keeping your content under your control while still reaching broader audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Webmentions, Micropub, and IndieAuth:</strong> These <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> standards are supported, allowing for rich interactions across the web, where comments or likes from one site can be reflected on another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ActivityPub:</strong> Part of the Fediverse, <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/" title="ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> for federation, allowing your posts to interact with users on other compatible platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subscription-model"><strong>Subscription Model:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> operates on a <strong>freemium model</strong>. The basic plan starts at just <strong>$1 per month</strong>, which includes:
<ul>
<li>Your own blog with unlimited posts</li>
<li>Your own domain name</li>
<li>Podcast hosting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced features like automatic cross-posting, video hosting, and enhanced cross-posting capabilities are available in higher tiers.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-and-flexibility"><strong>Freedom and Flexibility:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Use:</strong> Users are not locked into <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>. You can use your own domain, ensuring that if you decide to leave, your content and URL identity remain with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic GitHub Backup:</strong> Your blog can be backed up to a GitHub repository automatically, providing a secure, version-controlled backup of all your posts.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Archive:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> also offers periodic backups to the Internet Archive for long-term digital preservation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export Formats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugo Format:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> as its static site generator, which means all content can be exported in this format. This includes your posts in Markdown, theme files, and configuration, allowing for a seamless transition if you decide to self-host or move to another platform.</li>
<li>Additionally, exports can be done in JSON, Markdown, and other blog archive formats, ensuring your data is never trapped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-hugo-format"><strong>Why Hugo Format?</strong></h2>
<p>I recommend sticking with the Hugo format for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> Hugo is well-regarded in the static site generation community, making it easy to find hosting or move to another service.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> With all posts in Markdown, editing or updating content post-export is straightforward.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Customization:</strong> The theme files allow you to maintain the look and feel of your blog even if you switch platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.</p>
<p>Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a <strong>Nikon D7000</strong> while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.</p>

<p>They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.</p>

<p>This post and the comments within go on to explain the difference between Bluesky and the Fediverse. Quite interesting, and the main reason I chose to host my own Fediverse Instances over Bluesky.</p>

<p>Interesting. Though when it comes to WiFi and Bluetooth, make sure that you also turn off WiFi and Bluetooth scanning, as those run in the background even with WiFi and Bluetooth off and allow your devices to be found.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to support the fediverse and indieweb movements more by transitioning my website and online identity, own my own data and POSSE my posts across the various social media silos and make use of Webmentions.

<p>[youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJ91k4PBjs%5D">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the video, the little boy runs towards his father, who is filming him, in thick snow with only his shoes and underpants on, at times crying bitterly.</p>
<p>As he stands shivering in the cold, he is seen pleading with his father &lsquo;Please give me a hug!</p>
<p>On several occasions, both parents tell their son to lie down in the snow, which he does eventually when his mother presses him.</p>
<p>The film - posted online by his father, surnamed He, who comes from the eastern city of Nanjing - has been viewed by tens of thousands of people on various video-sharing websites and has caused outrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with this&hellip; We should give children a happy childhood, those terrible parents say they do this for their child&rsquo;s own good, but I think their purpose is just to be able to brag in the future,&rdquo; one netizen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t support this, poor kid, does the kid&rsquo;s mother let the father do whatever he wants to do?&rdquo; another person said on Sina&rsquo;s popular weibo microblogging service.</p>
<p>He has been given the nickname of &ldquo;Eagle Dad&rdquo; in reference to Chua, who sparked controversy when she wrote a book extolling the benefits of tough parenting.</p>
<p>His personal assistant, surnamed Xin, said He was on holiday with his family in New York during the Lunar New Year holiday last month, and decided to see in the Year of the Dragon with this unusual method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child agreed and before the run, he did half an hour of slow running to warm up,&rdquo; she said by phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child has received all sorts of forms of training since he was small. When he was one, he started swimming in water that was 21 degrees Celsius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said that the boy was born prematurely with several health problems including water in the brain that prompted doctors to say he may have cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now he has no problems,&rdquo; she said, attributing this to He&rsquo;s intense education method.</p>
<p>One person on Sina&rsquo;s weibo said teaching one&rsquo;s child about the cold and fortitude was a good thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if this method becomes a feature of everyday life, then the child&rsquo;s life learning process is just cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said He had disregarded the flood of online criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he doesn&rsquo;t care what others say&hellip; that the fact that the child lived showed that he has tenacious vitality,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tough &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; parenting methods have come under the spotlight recently, as children are increasingly forced to study hard at the expense of leisure activities to succeed in a job market that has become hugely competitive.</p>

			 <p>Received 4 missed phone calls for work this morning to start at 6am for a morning shift. Being as lazy as I am I missed those called. Is that a good thing? I had already planned to go to gym and do my weight training routing.</p>
<p>I think that is something about my personality. I don&rsquo;t mind working, though on-call I dislike last minute plans. When something is in my mind, I set to it and go for it.</p>
<p>So, I went to gym this morning for a Shoulder and Traps workout after eating some nice raisin toast for breakfast:</p>
<p>3 sets x 5 reps of each:
12kg Dumbell Shoulder Press (Cuban)
18kg Dumbell Row (Upright)
12kg Dumbell Raise (Lateral)
35kg Barbell Shoulder Press (Military)
100kg Barbell Shrugs
10kg Dumbel Raise (Front Incline Bench)
16kg Dumbell Row (Shoulder Prone)
35kg Dumbell Shrug (Incline Bench)</p>
<p>I was going to do my usual Muay Thai class tonight, but I got myself an afternoon shift starting at 4pm this evening.</p>
<p>Yesterday I enrolled to complete my Diploma of Food Science &amp; Technology (Nurtition Stream), so I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
