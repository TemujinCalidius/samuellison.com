<p>Recently, I have had a fascination with wanting to try out hiking in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading about night hiking and what the <a href="https://unlockoutdoors.com/benefits-of-night-hiking/">benefits</a> might be, including being able to stay cooler in the summer heat, experiencing the fascinating sounds of the nocturnal wildlife, and seeing the night sky up above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There’s something magical about hiking in nature at night. You just can&rsquo;t replicate the sights and the sounds of a nightime hike in the daytime. It&rsquo;s a fantastic way to reflect after a frantically busy day.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve also been looking into the various <a href="https://flyfreshflight.com/is-hiking-at-night-dangerous/">dangers</a> that come along with hiking at night too. In Australia (at least in Victoria), we don&rsquo;t have predatorial animals that are interested in humans, so the most common dangers are going to do with the lack of visibility, and these include your poor visibility, which increases your risk of getting lost and increases your risk of having trips and falls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It’s also easier to get lost when you’re hiking at night. The lack of light can make it difficult to see landmarks, and you may not be able to see the trail as well. If you do get lost, it’s important to stay calm and retrace your steps. If you’re unable to find your way back, call for help.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Well, on Monday the 10th of March 2025, I finally got to experience hiking in the darkness!</p>
<p>My wife and I checked our weather app and it was going to be a scorcher. That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky.</p>
<p>Initially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>
<p>So there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at <a href="https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park">Werribee Gorge</a>, about to do the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track">Long and Short Circuit Track combined</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark.</p>
<p>While I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.</p>
<p>The torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you&rsquo;d like to check out the torch, it&rsquo;s a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on <a href="https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam.</p>
<p>I also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet!<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Another thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there&rsquo;s plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.</p>
<h3 id="strange-sounds">Strange Sounds</h3>
<p>While commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that&rsquo;s how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.</p>
<p>I was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don&rsquo;t know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-came-the-next-challenge">And then came the next challenge.</h3>
<p>You see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below.</p>
<p>Putting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.</p>
<h3 id="serene-views--wildlife">Serene Views &amp; Wildlife</h3>
<p>On the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.</p>
<p>As the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system">filtration system</a>, of course), and you&rsquo;re actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it&rsquo;s a much sought after resource!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It&rsquo;s got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn&rsquo;t too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!</p>
<p>We finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Would I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let&rsquo;s see if we can tackle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge">Lerderderg Gorge</a> and I will let you all know how that goes!</p>
<p>And then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below.
What&rsquo;s your experience hiking in the darkness? Have you done it before? Would you do it again? If you haven&rsquo;t done it before, would you consider giving it a go?</p>

<p>While I have been a member of both the <a href="https://secondlife.com">SecondLife</a> and <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSimulator</a> platforms for some time, let&rsquo;s say, 16 years on Second Life, and 1 good year on OpenSimulator, it did not actually hit me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a> was already here with us until <a href="https://about.meta.com/">Meta&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wanted to create his own branded &ldquo;<a href="https://about.meta.com/metaverse/">Metaverse</a>&rdquo; to rule them all.</p>
<p>There was talk about Second Life briefly being the answer to the metaverse, but in reality, it does not tick all the boxes (think proprietary, centralized)</p>
<p>And then, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>, and learned about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indieweb</a> and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">Small Web</a> movements, and it became much clearer to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="opensimulator-the-metaverse">OpenSimulator, the Metaverse</h2>
<p>So, why do I consider OpenSimulator to tick all the boxes when it comes to being more along the lines of what the metaverse should truly be?</p>
<p>After being a member of the Fediverse for a few months now and learning about <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-decentralized-social-media/">decentralization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> and all those fancy words, I came to realise that the OpenSimulator platform, which seems from the outside to be just a clone of SecondLife, is actually the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is Free and Open Source Software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>), and secondly, and most importantly, it is completely decentralized. Allowing people to create their worlds (think, rooms) and connect them to existing grids (think, servers).</p>
<p>So, not only can you host your own worlds on an existing grid and create an account and personal identity on that grid (or server), but you also have the ability to do it yourself, host your own grid with as many worlds as you wish, and connect it to what is known as the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">Hypergrid</a>, and still be interconnected between all the different worlds, grids and so forth.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Region</strong> = World, or, Planet</li>
<li><strong>Grid</strong> = Server, or, Universe</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add a planet to someone else&rsquo;s universe, or you can create your own universe with your own rules and connect it, or not, to the Metaverse, or, Multiverse, officially known as the Hypergrid.</p>
<p>And it will always be there, no matter what happens to the rest of the universes (grids) out there.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do?</h2>
<p>I decided to host my own Region (or World) and connect it to the Grid (Universe) known as <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> which allows registered users to connect their own regions to their grid, at no cost (besides of course your own hosting costs).</p>
<p>This means, I used an existing avatar account to make the owner of my region and self-host it!</p>
<p>By default, region sizes are setup in the OpenSimulator configuration as 256x256 meters (which is also the size of regions on Second Life). It&rsquo;s actually possible to run much larger region sizes, or to host multiple regions together and place them next to each other to suits your needs.</p>
<p>In my case, I am running a single region, the size of 4x4 (16) regions. Basically, 1024x1024m in land size, and I can do whatever I like with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently bare though, and here&rsquo;s a screenshot of it in its current state.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on">What am I working on?</h2>
<p>I want to build a world based off of 28 Years Later. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/3iiyYkKXpxk">trailer</a> yet, I highly recommend that you do.</p>
<p>I love the idea of having a city which is going through a Zombie Apocalypse and the player having to fight their way through an infested city by smacking zombie NPCs and gathering resources, until they come across a stranded island that appears to be a safe-haven.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This safe-haven will be a village with roles for people to take on and to live their merry lives on. Roles might include things like farmers, smiths, carpenters and hunters. Hunters would go out back into the city, looking for valuable resources, such as metals, more foods, ammunition and medicines.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A fun survival style game.</p>
<p>How do you accomplish that on the Metaverse? Are you able to code?</p>
<h3 id="yes-you-can-code-on-the-metaverse">Yes, you can code on the Metaverse!</h3>
<p>Not only can you build your world with 3d mesh models and materials, in my case, assets I purchased from the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a> and converted them into usable formats using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a>; but you can code anything your heart desires in OpenSimulator (and yes, in Second Life too).</p>
<p>Both OpenSimulator and Second Life have their own scripting languages.</p>
<p>Second Life uses the <a href="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">Linden Scripting Language (LSL)</a> and OpenSimulator has a highly expanded, yet similar language known as <a href="">OpenSimulator Scripting Language (OSSL)</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of code so you can see how easy it is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>default {
    touch_start(integer num) {
        key player = llDetectedKey(0); // Get the avatar's key
        string playerName = llDetectedName(0); // Get the avatar's name

        // Send registration request to the data server
        llRegionSay(12345, &quot;Register|&quot; + (string)player + &quot;|&quot; + playerName);

        // Notify the player directly
        llSay(0, &quot;Registration request sent, &quot; + playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You can view more of my source that I have been working on within my <a href="https://github.com/TemujinCalidius/SurvivorCore">GitHub Repository</a>!</p>
<p>This is just a registration board that players can click on to register their avatar as a player in the system I am working on, but there&rsquo;s way more to do - such as having a HUD and floating text above avatars that tracks the players current survival stats, such as Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Infection as well as a multitude of other things, such as Inventory slots, Coins/Money and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-one-visit">How does one visit?</h2>
<p>To visit places on the OpenSimulator metaverse, you need a virtual world viewer.
And you need the version that allows connection to multiple grids and not just the default Second Life proprietary grid.</p>
<p>The best browser currently is the <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/">Firestorm</a> viewer.</p>
<p>You will need the OpenSimulator version which you can grab from here: <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/">https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/</a></p>
<p>There is support for Windows, Mac and Linux versions. I am using Linux and it works fine.</p>
<p>You can visit my land and come say hello when I am there, by adding the <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> option to your logins (by clicking on &ldquo;<strong>Click to add more grids</strong>&rdquo;, creating an account through the browsers &ldquo;<strong>Create an Account</strong>&rdquo; link and logging in.</p>
<p>Once you are in, open your world map in the view and search for &ldquo;counterearth&rdquo;. I will probably rename the region later to something that matches the RP game I wish to make and update this article when that is done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not much to see in my world currently, but I endeavour to post more updates on my proceedings and discuss the scripts I have come up with in further articles - so be sure to add this RSS to your reader to keep getting updates on my posts!</p>
<p>I hope that this has also inspired you into looking into the Metaverse and seeing how you could contribute with your coding knowledge to make the experience better for everyone out there! I believe the GitHub repository for OpenSimulator can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/opensim/opensim">https://github.com/opensim/opensim</a> and is coded in the C# language.</p>
<p>Have fun all!</p>

<p>Last night, my family and I attended the <strong>Shen Yun 2025</strong> performance at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre. It was the 6 PM session on Saturday, 15th February 2025, and the venue was packed to capacity. In fact, extra seats had to be released to accommodate the overwhelming demand—a testament to the growing popularity of this incredible show.</p>
<p>This was my fourth time attending Shen Yun, and I can confidently say it gets better every year. The artistry, storytelling, and sheer skill of the performers left me in awe once again. Shen Yun is not just a dance performance; it’s an immersive journey into Chinese traditional culture, told through a series of captivating stories. Each dance is a narrative, often inspired by the principles of <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>—a spiritual practice that emphasises <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the story of &ldquo;Enlightenment,&rdquo; which deeply resonated with me. It followed an army commander grappling with the aftermath of a battle, seeking redemption through spiritual cultivation. The tale was both moving and thought-provoking, reminding me of the challenges we all face in overcoming distractions and attachments in our lives.</p>
<p>Shen Yun also touches on profound themes, including the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China. Since 1999, the practice has been banned under the communist regime, which views large, independent movements as a threat. Some of the stories depicted the harsh realities faced by practitioners, including imprisonment and even organ harvesting—issues that remain under scrutiny on the global stage.</p>
<p>While Shen Yun has faced challenges in Australia, particularly in Victoria, this year’s performance felt like a turning point. The messaging was more subtle, focusing on the dangers of atheism and the importance of staying true to one’s faith or tradition. It was a refreshing approach that seemed to resonate with the audience, regardless of their personal beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="a-journey-through-stories-and-values">A Journey Through Stories and Values</h2>
<p>Shen Yun’s performances are structured as a series of short stories, each with its own unique message and artistic flair. The dances are accompanied by a live orchestra that blends traditional Chinese instruments with Western symphonic elements, creating an unforgettable auditory experience.</p>
<p>One of the standout stories for me was &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo; It begins with an army commander surveying the devastation of a battlefield. Overcome with guilt, he contemplates suicide but is stopped by a Buddhist abbot, who guides him toward spiritual cultivation. The commander renounces his attachments and joins a monastery, where he faces tests of his resolve. From temptations of wealth and power to the distractions of worldly desires, the story mirrors the struggles we all face when trying to meditate or focus on self-improvement.</p>
<p>The commander’s ultimate success in achieving enlightenment was beautifully portrayed, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and inspiration. It’s a story that lingers in your mind, encouraging introspection long after the performance ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-subtle-evolution-of-shen-yun">The Subtle Evolution of Shen Yun</h2>
<p>As a <strong>Falun Dafa practitioner</strong>, I’ve noticed how Shen Yun has evolved over the years. Earlier performances leaned heavily into the spiritual aspects of Falun Dafa, which may have felt overwhelming to some Western audiences. This year, however, the messaging was more balanced. The focus shifted toward universal values and the dangers of losing touch with spirituality, making it more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The show’s ability to convey these messages through art is what makes it so special. It’s not just about promoting Falun Dafa; it’s about encouraging people to reflect on their own values and traditions, whatever they may be. This subtlety was a welcome change and, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-to-explore">A Call to Explore</h2>
<p>If you’ve never experienced Shen Yun, I highly recommend attending when it comes to your city. It’s more than just a performance—it’s an opportunity to connect with timeless values and immerse yourself in a rich cultural tradition. For more information about Shen Yun, visit <a href="https://www.shenyun.com/">https://www.shenyun.com/</a>.</p>
<p>For those curious about <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>, I encourage you to explore it at your own pace. There are no memberships, ceremonies, or obligations—just a chance to learn and grow through the principles of <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>. You can find more information at <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">https://en.falundafa.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Shen Yun 2025 was a night to remember, and I’m already looking forward to next year’s performance. It’s a reminder of the beauty of art, the power of storytelling, and the importance of staying true to our values in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p>Hiking has become a cherished activity for me, and it’s even more special when shared with loved ones. Two days ago, I embarked on a hike with my mother through the <strong>Whipstick Loop Walk</strong>, located in <strong>Blackwood, Victoria</strong>, within the <strong>Wombat State Forest</strong>. This 5.8 km loop trail, which takes about two hours to complete, is a relatively easy and scenic walk, perfect for someone like my mother, who is rediscovering hiking after decades.</p>
<p>The trail is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from ferny rainforests near the river to classic Australian bushland with towering eucalypts. It’s a sensory delight, with the crunch of debris underfoot, the fresh smells of eucalyptus and ferns, and the melodic calls of native birds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-day">Preparing for the Day</h3>
<p>We set out on <strong>Friday, 14th February 2024</strong>, a pleasant summer day with a temperature of 23°C. I picked up my mother at 8:00 am, and we arrived at the trailhead by 9:00 am. The previous day’s light rain had left the trail floor scattered with leaves and twigs, adding to the charm of the walk.</p>
<p>Given my mother’s age (65+) and her recent return to hiking, I carefully chose this trail for its gentle inclines and stable footing. It’s a great option for beginner hikers or those easing back into the activity. You can find more details about the trail on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/whipstick-loop-walk">AllTrails</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wildlife-encounters">Wildlife Encounters</h3>
<p>About halfway through the walk, we were thrilled to spot a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala"><strong>koala</strong></a> perched on a young gum tree. It was munching on leaves and scratching itself—a behaviour I later learned is a way for koalas to spread their scent. Here’s the photo I captured:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Later, as we neared the three-quarter mark of the trail, we were treated to another magical moment. Four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_boobook"><strong>southern boobook owls</strong></a> flew by, and one landed on a branch right in front of us. I managed to snap a photo of it as it turned its head in a near 270-degree spin. These owls are Australia’s smallest and most common owl species. Here’s the image:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-trails-beauty">The Trail’s Beauty</h3>
<p>One of the things I love most about the Whipstick Loop Walk is its variety. The trail transitions from lush rainforest-like areas near the river to classic Australian bushland as you gain elevation. The eucalypts here bear the marks of bushfires and strong winds, creating a dramatic and rugged landscape.</p>
<p>Although it’s summer and not the ideal season for fungi, I couldn’t help but reminisce about my previous visits during autumn. The decomposing logs and damp conditions then bring out stunning mushrooms, perfect for photography. On this trip, I didn’t bring my professional camera, but I did snap some of my favourite fungi photos on past visits. Here’s one of a cluster of red mushrooms I captured with my trusty <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000"><strong>Nikon D7000</strong></a>, a 14-year-old camera that still delivers stunning results:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>The hike was a wonderful experience, not just for the natural beauty but for the time spent with my mother. She worked up a sweat by the end, but the cool forest temperatures (ranging from 14°C to 19°C) kept the exertion manageable. It’s heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and I’m grateful for these moments we share.</p>
<p>I plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-microbloghttpsmicroblog-microblog"><strong>What is <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> is a unique social platform and blogging service designed for individuals who value owning their content and fostering genuine community interactions. It&rsquo;s built on the principles of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a>, emphasizing personal domain control, content ownership, and interoperability with other web services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-creator"><strong>The Creator:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.manton.org/" title="Manton Reece">Manton Reece</a></strong> is the mind behind <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>. With a background in software development and a passion for reviving the personal blogging culture, Manton has crafted <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> since its inception through a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing" title="Micro.Blog Kickstarter Campaign">Kickstarter</a> campaign in 2017. His vision was to create a space where blogging feels like tweeting but retains the essence of personal web ownership.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indieweb-practices"><strong>IndieWeb Practices:</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> actively incorporates several <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own Your Content:</strong> Users are encouraged to use their own domain names. The service supports mapping your personal domain to your <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> account, ensuring you maintain control over your digital identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere):</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> facilitates posting from your own site and syndicating to various platforms like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app" title="BlueSky">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, and others, automatically, thereby keeping your content under your control while still reaching broader audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Webmentions, Micropub, and IndieAuth:</strong> These <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> standards are supported, allowing for rich interactions across the web, where comments or likes from one site can be reflected on another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ActivityPub:</strong> Part of the Fediverse, <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/" title="ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> for federation, allowing your posts to interact with users on other compatible platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subscription-model"><strong>Subscription Model:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> operates on a <strong>freemium model</strong>. The basic plan starts at just <strong>$1 per month</strong>, which includes:
<ul>
<li>Your own blog with unlimited posts</li>
<li>Your own domain name</li>
<li>Podcast hosting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced features like automatic cross-posting, video hosting, and enhanced cross-posting capabilities are available in higher tiers.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-and-flexibility"><strong>Freedom and Flexibility:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Use:</strong> Users are not locked into <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>. You can use your own domain, ensuring that if you decide to leave, your content and URL identity remain with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic GitHub Backup:</strong> Your blog can be backed up to a GitHub repository automatically, providing a secure, version-controlled backup of all your posts.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Archive:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> also offers periodic backups to the Internet Archive for long-term digital preservation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export Formats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugo Format:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> as its static site generator, which means all content can be exported in this format. This includes your posts in Markdown, theme files, and configuration, allowing for a seamless transition if you decide to self-host or move to another platform.</li>
<li>Additionally, exports can be done in JSON, Markdown, and other blog archive formats, ensuring your data is never trapped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-hugo-format"><strong>Why Hugo Format?</strong></h2>
<p>I recommend sticking with the Hugo format for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> Hugo is well-regarded in the static site generation community, making it easy to find hosting or move to another service.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> With all posts in Markdown, editing or updating content post-export is straightforward.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Customization:</strong> The theme files allow you to maintain the look and feel of your blog even if you switch platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> stands out as a service that not only promotes but practically implements <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> principles, offering a platform where blogging feels intimate yet expansive. Its commitment to user freedom, with easy data portability and the encouragement of personal domain use, makes it an excellent choice for those who value their digital independence. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned blogger or just starting, <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> offers a way to engage with the web that feels authentic and owned by you.</p>

			 <p>This post is basically a re-post of some of my favourite photos so that you are able to find them.</p>
<p>When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.</p>
<p>Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a <strong>Nikon D7000</strong> while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will make all of these photos available on my <a href="https://https://www.patreon.com/thesporetrail">Patron</a> page for FREE. You can become a member for free and download all of these in their original format.</p>
<p>They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will enjoy these. Please let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Video of boy crying in snow sparks uproar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. (NineMsn)</p>
<p>[youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJ91k4PBjs%5D">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the video, the little boy runs towards his father, who is filming him, in thick snow with only his shoes and underpants on, at times crying bitterly.</p>
<p>As he stands shivering in the cold, he is seen pleading with his father &lsquo;Please give me a hug!</p>
<p>On several occasions, both parents tell their son to lie down in the snow, which he does eventually when his mother presses him.</p>
<p>The film - posted online by his father, surnamed He, who comes from the eastern city of Nanjing - has been viewed by tens of thousands of people on various video-sharing websites and has caused outrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with this&hellip; We should give children a happy childhood, those terrible parents say they do this for their child&rsquo;s own good, but I think their purpose is just to be able to brag in the future,&rdquo; one netizen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t support this, poor kid, does the kid&rsquo;s mother let the father do whatever he wants to do?&rdquo; another person said on Sina&rsquo;s popular weibo microblogging service.</p>
<p>He has been given the nickname of &ldquo;Eagle Dad&rdquo; in reference to Chua, who sparked controversy when she wrote a book extolling the benefits of tough parenting.</p>
<p>His personal assistant, surnamed Xin, said He was on holiday with his family in New York during the Lunar New Year holiday last month, and decided to see in the Year of the Dragon with this unusual method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child agreed and before the run, he did half an hour of slow running to warm up,&rdquo; she said by phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child has received all sorts of forms of training since he was small. When he was one, he started swimming in water that was 21 degrees Celsius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said that the boy was born prematurely with several health problems including water in the brain that prompted doctors to say he may have cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now he has no problems,&rdquo; she said, attributing this to He&rsquo;s intense education method.</p>
<p>One person on Sina&rsquo;s weibo said teaching one&rsquo;s child about the cold and fortitude was a good thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if this method becomes a feature of everyday life, then the child&rsquo;s life learning process is just cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said He had disregarded the flood of online criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he doesn&rsquo;t care what others say&hellip; that the fact that the child lived showed that he has tenacious vitality,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tough &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; parenting methods have come under the spotlight recently, as children are increasingly forced to study hard at the expense of leisure activities to succeed in a job market that has become hugely competitive.</p>

			 <p>Received 4 missed phone calls for work this morning to start at 6am for a morning shift. Being as lazy as I am I missed those called. Is that a good thing? I had already planned to go to gym and do my weight training routing.</p>
<p>I think that is something about my personality. I don&rsquo;t mind working, though on-call I dislike last minute plans. When something is in my mind, I set to it and go for it.</p>
<p>So, I went to gym this morning for a Shoulder and Traps workout after eating some nice raisin toast for breakfast:</p>
<p>3 sets x 5 reps of each:
12kg Dumbell Shoulder Press (Cuban)
18kg Dumbell Row (Upright)
12kg Dumbell Raise (Lateral)
35kg Barbell Shoulder Press (Military)
100kg Barbell Shrugs
10kg Dumbel Raise (Front Incline Bench)
16kg Dumbell Row (Shoulder Prone)
35kg Dumbell Shrug (Incline Bench)</p>
<p>I was going to do my usual Muay Thai class tonight, but I got myself an afternoon shift starting at 4pm this evening.</p>
<p>Yesterday I enrolled to complete my Diploma of Food Science &amp; Technology (Nurtition Stream), so I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
