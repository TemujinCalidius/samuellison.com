<p>Just a quick 2 hour hike. We found a #Koala as well as some #Owls!</p>

			 <p>I am going to go out of the way to put this one directly on my website, as this dude got offended and actually blocked me for responding to his post with &ldquo;I love my Tesla though&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Weak, really, took offense that easily to a respectful response to your public post? Now your public post can eternally remain public in memory :)</p>

On the hike, we spotted two groups of wild #goats and a cute #wallaby who were all curious as to what we were doing.</p>

			 <p>My mother at the age of above 65, suddenly decides that now is a good time to take up #hiking with me. So I&rsquo;ll take her on a easy, flat 7km trail today with no real inclines. Should take 2 hours or so. See how we go.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-microbloghttpsmicroblog-microblog"><strong>What is <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> is a unique social platform and blogging service designed for individuals who value owning their content and fostering genuine community interactions. It&rsquo;s built on the principles of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a>, emphasizing personal domain control, content ownership, and interoperability with other web services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-creator"><strong>The Creator:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.manton.org/" title="Manton Reece">Manton Reece</a></strong> is the mind behind <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>. With a background in software development and a passion for reviving the personal blogging culture, Manton has crafted <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> since its inception through a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing" title="Micro.Blog Kickstarter Campaign">Kickstarter</a> campaign in 2017. His vision was to create a space where blogging feels like tweeting but retains the essence of personal web ownership.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indieweb-practices"><strong>IndieWeb Practices:</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> actively incorporates several <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Own Your Content:</strong> Users are encouraged to use their own domain names. The service supports mapping your personal domain to your <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> account, ensuring you maintain control over your digital identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere):</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> facilitates posting from your own site and syndicating to various platforms like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" title="Mastodon">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app" title="BlueSky">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://linkedin.com" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>, and others, automatically, thereby keeping your content under your control while still reaching broader audiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Webmentions, Micropub, and IndieAuth:</strong> These <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> standards are supported, allowing for rich interactions across the web, where comments or likes from one site can be reflected on another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ActivityPub:</strong> Part of the Fediverse, <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/" title="ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a> for federation, allowing your posts to interact with users on other compatible platforms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subscription-model"><strong>Subscription Model:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> operates on a <strong>freemium model</strong>. The basic plan starts at just <strong>$1 per month</strong>, which includes:
<ul>
<li>Your own blog with unlimited posts</li>
<li>Your own domain name</li>
<li>Podcast hosting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced features like automatic cross-posting, video hosting, and enhanced cross-posting capabilities are available in higher tiers.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-and-flexibility"><strong>Freedom and Flexibility:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Use:</strong> Users are not locked into <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a>. You can use your own domain, ensuring that if you decide to leave, your content and URL identity remain with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backup Options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic GitHub Backup:</strong> Your blog can be backed up to a GitHub repository automatically, providing a secure, version-controlled backup of all your posts.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Archive:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> also offers periodic backups to the Internet Archive for long-term digital preservation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export Formats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugo Format:</strong> <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> uses <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> as its static site generator, which means all content can be exported in this format. This includes your posts in Markdown, theme files, and configuration, allowing for a seamless transition if you decide to self-host or move to another platform.</li>
<li>Additionally, exports can be done in JSON, Markdown, and other blog archive formats, ensuring your data is never trapped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-hugo-format"><strong>Why Hugo Format?</strong></h2>
<p>I recommend sticking with the Hugo format for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Portability:</strong> Hugo is well-regarded in the static site generation community, making it easy to find hosting or move to another service.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> With all posts in Markdown, editing or updating content post-export is straightforward.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Customization:</strong> The theme files allow you to maintain the look and feel of your blog even if you switch platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> stands out as a service that not only promotes but practically implements <a href="https://indieweb.org/%22IndieWeb%22">IndieWeb</a> principles, offering a platform where blogging feels intimate yet expansive. Its commitment to user freedom, with easy data portability and the encouragement of personal domain use, makes it an excellent choice for those who value their digital independence. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned blogger or just starting, <a href="https://micro.blog" title="Micro.Blog">Micro.blog</a> offers a way to engage with the web that feels authentic and owned by you.</p>

			 <p>This post is basically a re-post of some of my favourite photos so that you are able to find them.</p>
<p>When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.</p>
<p>Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a <strong>Nikon D7000</strong> while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will make all of these photos available on my <a href="https://https://www.patreon.com/thesporetrail">Patron</a> page for FREE. You can become a member for free and download all of these in their original format.</p>
<p>They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will enjoy these. Please let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Fediverse is an important step in the freedom of the internet and owning our own data.</p>
<p>I enjoy sharing my photos on Pixelfed where there are no algorithms, likes and views.</p>

<p>Interesting. Though when it comes to WiFi and Bluetooth, make sure that you also turn off WiFi and Bluetooth scanning, as those run in the background even with WiFi and Bluetooth off and allow your devices to be found.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to support the fediverse and indieweb movements more by transitioning my website and online identity, own my own data and POSSE my posts across the various social media silos and make use of Webmentions. Still a lot of work to go, but making my own HTML is fun! Https://samuellison.com</p>
