<p>Last night, my family and I attended the <strong>Shen Yun 2025</strong> performance at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre. It was the 6 PM session on Saturday, 15th February 2025, and the venue was packed to capacity. In fact, extra seats had to be released to accommodate the overwhelming demandâ€”a testament to the growing popularity of this incredible show.</p>
<p>This was my fourth time attending Shen Yun, and I can confidently say it gets better every year. The artistry, storytelling, and sheer skill of the performers left me in awe once again. Shen Yun is not just a dance performance; itâ€™s an immersive journey into Chinese traditional culture, told through a series of captivating stories. Each dance is a narrative, often inspired by the principles of <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>â€”a spiritual practice that emphasises <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the story of &ldquo;Enlightenment,&rdquo; which deeply resonated with me. It followed an army commander grappling with the aftermath of a battle, seeking redemption through spiritual cultivation. The tale was both moving and thought-provoking, reminding me of the challenges we all face in overcoming distractions and attachments in our lives.</p>
<p>Shen Yun also touches on profound themes, including the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China. Since 1999, the practice has been banned under the communist regime, which views large, independent movements as a threat. Some of the stories depicted the harsh realities faced by practitioners, including imprisonment and even organ harvestingâ€”issues that remain under scrutiny on the global stage.</p>
<p>While Shen Yun has faced challenges in Australia, particularly in Victoria, this yearâ€™s performance felt like a turning point. The messaging was more subtle, focusing on the dangers of atheism and the importance of staying true to oneâ€™s faith or tradition. It was a refreshing approach that seemed to resonate with the audience, regardless of their personal beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="a-journey-through-stories-and-values">A Journey Through Stories and Values</h2>
<p>Shen Yunâ€™s performances are structured as a series of short stories, each with its own unique message and artistic flair. The dances are accompanied by a live orchestra that blends traditional Chinese instruments with Western symphonic elements, creating an unforgettable auditory experience.</p>
<p>One of the standout stories for me was &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo; It begins with an army commander surveying the devastation of a battlefield. Overcome with guilt, he contemplates suicide but is stopped by a Buddhist abbot, who guides him toward spiritual cultivation. The commander renounces his attachments and joins a monastery, where he faces tests of his resolve. From temptations of wealth and power to the distractions of worldly desires, the story mirrors the struggles we all face when trying to meditate or focus on self-improvement.</p>
<p>The commanderâ€™s ultimate success in achieving enlightenment was beautifully portrayed, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and inspiration. Itâ€™s a story that lingers in your mind, encouraging introspection long after the performance ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-subtle-evolution-of-shen-yun">The Subtle Evolution of Shen Yun</h2>
<p>As a <strong>Falun Dafa practitioner</strong>, Iâ€™ve noticed how Shen Yun has evolved over the years. Earlier performances leaned heavily into the spiritual aspects of Falun Dafa, which may have felt overwhelming to some Western audiences. This year, however, the messaging was more balanced. The focus shifted toward universal values and the dangers of losing touch with spirituality, making it more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The showâ€™s ability to convey these messages through art is what makes it so special. Itâ€™s not just about promoting Falun Dafa; itâ€™s about encouraging people to reflect on their own values and traditions, whatever they may be. This subtlety was a welcome change and, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-to-explore">A Call to Explore</h2>
<p>If youâ€™ve never experienced Shen Yun, I highly recommend attending when it comes to your city. Itâ€™s more than just a performanceâ€”itâ€™s an opportunity to connect with timeless values and immerse yourself in a rich cultural tradition. For more information about Shen Yun, visit <a href="https://www.shenyun.com/">https://www.shenyun.com/</a>.</p>
<p>For those curious about <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>, I encourage you to explore it at your own pace. There are no memberships, ceremonies, or obligationsâ€”just a chance to learn and grow through the principles of <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>. You can find more information at <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">https://en.falundafa.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Shen Yun 2025 was a night to remember, and Iâ€™m already looking forward to next yearâ€™s performance. Itâ€™s a reminder of the beauty of art, the power of storytelling, and the importance of staying true to our values in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p>Hiking has become a cherished activity for me, and itâ€™s even more special when shared with loved ones. Two days ago, I embarked on a hike with my mother through the <strong>Whipstick Loop Walk</strong>, located in <strong>Blackwood, Victoria</strong>, within the <strong>Wombat State Forest</strong>. This 5.8 km loop trail, which takes about two hours to complete, is a relatively easy and scenic walk, perfect for someone like my mother, who is rediscovering hiking after decades.</p>
<p>The trail is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from ferny rainforests near the river to classic Australian bushland with towering eucalypts. Itâ€™s a sensory delight, with the crunch of debris underfoot, the fresh smells of eucalyptus and ferns, and the melodic calls of native birds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-day">Preparing for the Day</h3>
<p>We set out on <strong>Friday, 14th February 2024</strong>, a pleasant summer day with a temperature of 23Â°C. I picked up my mother at 8:00 am, and we arrived at the trailhead by 9:00 am. The previous dayâ€™s light rain had left the trail floor scattered with leaves and twigs, adding to the charm of the walk.</p>
<p>Given my motherâ€™s age (65+) and her recent return to hiking, I carefully chose this trail for its gentle inclines and stable footing. Itâ€™s a great option for beginner hikers or those easing back into the activity. You can find more details about the trail on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/whipstick-loop-walk">AllTrails</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wildlife-encounters">Wildlife Encounters</h3>
<p>About halfway through the walk, we were thrilled to spot a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala"><strong>koala</strong></a> perched on a young gum tree. It was munching on leaves and scratching itselfâ€”a behaviour I later learned is a way for koalas to spread their scent. Hereâ€™s the photo I captured:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Later, as we neared the three-quarter mark of the trail, we were treated to another magical moment. Four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_boobook"><strong>southern boobook owls</strong></a> flew by, and one landed on a branch right in front of us. I managed to snap a photo of it as it turned its head in a near 270-degree spin. These owls are Australiaâ€™s smallest and most common owl species. Hereâ€™s the image:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-trails-beauty">The Trailâ€™s Beauty</h3>
<p>One of the things I love most about the Whipstick Loop Walk is its variety. The trail transitions from lush rainforest-like areas near the river to classic Australian bushland as you gain elevation. The eucalypts here bear the marks of bushfires and strong winds, creating a dramatic and rugged landscape.</p>
<p>Although itâ€™s summer and not the ideal season for fungi, I couldnâ€™t help but reminisce about my previous visits during autumn. The decomposing logs and damp conditions then bring out stunning mushrooms, perfect for photography. On this trip, I didnâ€™t bring my professional camera, but I did snap some of my favourite fungi photos on past visits. Hereâ€™s one of a cluster of red mushrooms I captured with my trusty <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000"><strong>Nikon D7000</strong></a>, a 14-year-old camera that still delivers stunning results:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>The hike was a wonderful experience, not just for the natural beauty but for the time spent with my mother. She worked up a sweat by the end, but the cool forest temperatures (ranging from 14Â°C to 19Â°C) kept the exertion manageable. Itâ€™s heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and Iâ€™m grateful for these moments we share.</p>
<p>I plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.</p>

			 <p>So with these new law changes coming eventually to social media, including the need to verify ourselves with ID to prove our age - how does that look for #Mastodon and other #Fediverse social media? In particular the larger instances that have responsibility to its user base under their own countries laws?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this would affect small private servers in any way, but I&rsquo;m interested to know more&hellip;</p>

			 <p>This post is basically a re-post of some of my favourite photos so that you are able to find them.</p>
<p>When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.</p>
<p>Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a <strong>Nikon D7000</strong> while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will make all of these photos available on my <a href="https://https://www.patreon.com/thesporetrail">Patron</a> page for FREE. You can become a member for free and download all of these in their original format.</p>
<p>They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will enjoy these. Please let me know in the comments what you think.</p>
