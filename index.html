<h2 id="back-to-live-streaming">Back to Live Streaming</h2>
<p>I am getting my groove back within #SecondLife and in particular with my #IndieGame project, #SLColonies.</p>
<p>I played about with #OBS for a day and setup all my scenes and did away with the #ZowieBox external streaming box which was giving me the most issues, and just did it straight on the computer. More resource intensive, but for my needs, much more simplistic and manageable.</p>
<p>We did a #LiveStream and it went well. 13 watching at the same time, which is actually pretty good for our small community of players.</p>
<p>If you want to see our streaming format, check out the playback of the stream below and let me know what you think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="photoshop-to-gimp">Photoshop to GIMP</h2>
<p>With my mood coming back for being productive in our indie-game, and my move away from #Adobe products in general and more into Free and Open Source Software ( #FOSS ), I had to convert some  Photoshop shop templates to work within GIMP.</p>
<p>I mostly got that <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/28/been-playing-around-with-an.html">working</a> thankfully!</p>
<h2 id="melbourne-zoo">Melbourne Zoo</h2>
<p>On the weekend, I was mostly busy with a full day at the zoo with the girls and practising more photography and post-processing in #DarkTable. Still a long way to go for me, but I am happy with the progress and my workflow!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a gallery of the photos I took this week:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And this is my favourite image of the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All in all, these photo&rsquo;s were stunning to my eye and I enjoyed the process within DarkTable to bring these RAW images to life. The old #Nikon #D7000 may be going on 15 years old and is still a #DSLR with mirror, and may not have the quality of the latest smart phones, but it was still great for what I managed to do with it, with the lens I am limited to using.</p>
<p>You can grab these photos for FREE, including in .TIF full quality format for print quality up to A3 I think from memory. And if you want to support my work, I do appreciate donations to the value you feel my work is worth to your eye - or even a monthly contribution.</p>
<p>You can visit my Ko-Fi page at <a href="https://ko-fi.com/samuellison">https://ko-fi.com/samuellison</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading up to here, and I look forward to more exciting days to come!</p>
<p>I have 6 more days off work to go and plan on going on small walks and hikes by myself and with my mother.</p>

			 <p>Busy morning. Although unproductive in terms of getting my daily routine done. But other that that, I spent a lot of time on #SLColonies and within #SecondLife working on our new Questing System and creating some quest lines for our customers.</p>

			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I feel like I had a pretty unproductive week. And I do my best to blame the fact that I was on #NightShift for the week at work, but really, as much as I can whine and carry on that I was a little tired, looking back, I could have pushed forward and at least ticked off my tasks instead of sit at the computer screen not really doing much.</p>
<p>Disappointed in myself yet again this week. I need to find myself better methods to ensure that I complete what I had set out to do.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m productive at work though, so that&rsquo;s not the issue. It&rsquo;s the procrastination when I get home after work prior to jumping into bed. I can do better.</p>
<p>So, what DID I get up to with my time then?</p>
<h2 id="method-for-breaking-sleep-routine">Method for Breaking Sleep Routine</h2>
<p>One thing that I and many others find hard about night shift, in particular with flexible shift work,  where shifts can go from mornings to afternoons and vice versa every week, and one whole week can be a night shift with the weeks after being back to mornings/afternoons again is the damage is does to your routine and way of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not at all the same as just <em>being on night shift</em> permanently, which that in itself has its own long-term effects on the human body. It&rsquo;s 7 nights with a recovery day, and back into flexible rostering after nights.</p>
<p>Right now, due to resourcing issues, we are on minimum night shifts. Meaning, we do a night shift week, every 4th week.</p>
<p>So how do I tackle getting into the first night of night shifts after being on different hours and regular sleeping routines?</p>
<p>I use to just try and push the first night and not change anything - no extra sleep, just straight into night shift and try to stay awake on the first night.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t work. In actuality, it&rsquo;s dangerous in my line of work in emergency services. We need to be awake, we need to not be fatigued and we need to have the mental capacity to deal with highly stressful situations.</p>
<p>Now, I will go out of my way, the night prior to my first night shift, to stay up as long as I can through the night. If that means #BingeWatching movies or playing games, and drinking lots of #coffee, then so be it. I will do my best to stay away until between 5 and 7am the next morning. If I need a quick nap after that, I will give myself a 1 to 2 hour teaser nap and keep pushing through, doing activities with the family if I can.</p>
<p>I then aim to go to sleep around lunch time and get as much sleep as possible. Between 6 to 8 hours before waking up and getting ready for that first night shift.</p>
<p>It worked wonders for me last week, and I started my first night feeling fully rejuvenated and ready for the action - and glad I did, because the first night was quite a busy one that required focus, attention to detail and the ability to react!</p>
<p>In saying that, here in Australia it&rsquo;s currently the end of Autumn and hitting the edge of winter. So nights are longer and days are colder. So it&rsquo;s much easier to fall asleep rugged up, than it is sweating in the heat. I&rsquo;ll get back to you all if I manage to keep this method up during the warmer months!</p>
<h2 id="beautiful-music--guitar-playing">Beautiful Music &amp; Guitar Playing</h2>
<p>My daughter has been learning to play the guitar and has taken a fancy for finger picking vs using a pick for her playing, and her new tutor is doing well as teaching her.</p>
<p>With this, I went back to some old music I enjoy listening to and looked up Estas Tonne, to have my daughter listen to it and see what she thought.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s such beautiful music. Put on some headphones, close your eyes, listen, enjoy the story that unfolds.</p>
<h2 id="change-of-milk">Change of Milk</h2>
<p>This week, I changed my milk supply. Exciting, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/22/i-dont-know-why-i.html">samuellison.com/2025/05/2&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t move to more expensive milk and organic milks until now. So much more creamy and tastier. Way more wholesome too.
#WholeFoods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know I know, so exciting it was worthy of making the weekly recap. That, or I am finding anything to add to this week due to my utter laziness procrastinating at home when I am nights!</p>
<h2 id="camera-shopping">Camera Shopping</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking exactly which camera I want to upgrade to for my photography, from the #NikonD7000 I am currently using.</p>
<p>Originally, I was thinking about the Sony A6700 ASP-C camera, which is a great purchase. But, if I am going to invest so much into a camera, why not full frame in that case. Especially since my focus in photography is currently #Macro and in particular, #Fungi.</p>
<p><a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/24/one-more-day-to-go.html">samuellison.com/2025/05/2&hellip;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One more day to go of #NightShift! Having a coffee now that I am home. So, other than that&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the #camera I wish to purchase. And have decided to go with an #Sony #A7RV instead of the #A6700. $2k price difference, but I don&rsquo;t think I will regret it long-term.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided I will go with the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7rm5-b">Sony AR7V</a>. It will be much more forgiving for me, and due to the fact that I can do macro with 61 megapixels and, if I find I need to, I have plenty of detail to be able to crop in and still get pristine images.</p>
<p>This purchase would last me a very long time. And I feel much more comfortable investing in some good lenses for a camera I own, over purchasing lenses for the Nikon I am currently using, which is not mine.</p>
<h2 id="more-tech-m2-ssd-upgrade">More Tech (M.2 SSD Upgrade)</h2>
<p>I went ahead and purchased a new 2TB M.2 SSD to plug into my mothyerboard, which will replace the 512gb one I have currently.</p>
<p>This is so that when I do my photography and videos, I can drag all my raw and unedited content there for post-editing. This will allow me to do my photo editing in #DarkTable much fast than working with files over the network on the NAS. Same with video editing.</p>
<p>While shopping for this SSD, I realised however, that bus speeds have progressed on motherboards and that my motherboard is now quite ancient. They have PCIe 5.0 now, which would upgrade my SSD speed from around 3,000MB/s to 14,000MB/s!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s phenomenal. Unfortunately though, that means I need a motherboard upgrade that has PCIe M.2 slots. And that also means the CPU needs upgrading to the new socket types, as well as my memory going from DDR4 to DDR5. I can&rsquo;t use the same CPU and memory in modern motherboards.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will keep my old 512gig M.2 SSD for when I do upgrade my motherboard in future. As I will be able to re-use that, I believe! And get myself one of those new fancy PCIe 5.0 versions for the editing drive.  That&rsquo;ll put me on 4 x M.2 drives by the time I am ready for the upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Another week gone for 2025. Almost half way. Amazing how quick a year can escape you before you realise it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>Make the most of it everyone!</p>

<h2 id="lake-daylesford">Lake Daylesford</h2>
<p>With spring here, I anticipated that my usual haunt out at #LakeDaylesford here in Victoria would have plenty mushrooms. I mean, it&rsquo;s almost the end of spring now, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Daylesford">Lake Daylesford</a> has never ceased to amaze me with its flourish of mushrooms. The beautiful red and white spotted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria">Amanita Muscaria</a> are usually always there this time of year, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suillus">Slippery Jacks</a>.</p>
<p>This year however, it seems there was a bit of a drought. That, or the local council finally put an end to it and removed all the mushrooms to prevent people getting sick?</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s the weather, as I went up the road to a usual lookout for a waterfall, and there was no water flowing at all this year. This is concerning.</p>
<p>Anyway, I took my mother to Lake Daylesford and we had a wonderful walk around the lake. I didn&rsquo;t manage to snap any high quality photos of mushrooms, and yes, I did find a <em>single</em> Amanita out there on its own, but I didn&rsquo;t manage to get a good photo using my camera. I did get a sneaky shot on my phone though.

</a>

</p>
<p>Other than that photo though, I did manage to snap and edit some beautiful shots of the lake and surrounds.</p>
<p>I am most proud of this one from the day. The colours really came out well post-edit and I like the composition. Looking at it now though, I could have centred the house perfectly and cropped out some of the leaves showing on the right of the image.

  />
</a>

</p>
<p>In this photo of the bench, I thought it looked nice and told a little story in itself. The lonely bench with no one sitting on it currently, looking over the waters. I like how the plants up ahead in the lake just happened to align with the bench though. Again, I could have centred it better post-editing.

  />
</a>

</p>
<p>I loved this overall shot of the lake. I didn&rsquo;t have a wide enough lens with me to really capture it all, but now thinking about it, I should have zoomed in more and captured the area to the left reaching over to the centre of the photo and captured more detail there, perhaps centering the largest tree there to the image. Maybe next time!

</a>

</p>
<p>Actually, below is an edit of that photo just to see. Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t currently have a powerful enough camera to crop in so much and I lose a lot of the detail. Still cannot wait to get my new camera! And looking at the photo again, I should show the full reflection of that tree in the water too! Live and learn!

  />
</a>

</p>
<p>Then I tried something new for me by taking a photo directly into the sun. I noticed a young boy fishing and setting up his rod. The reflection of the sun in the water was nice and I felt this photo looked best in a black and white setting, making the boy look more like a silhouette style photo.

</p>
<p>Before leaving Lake Daylesford, I then took my mother to the local botanical garden known as <a href="https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/daylesford-and-the-macedon-ranges/see-and-do/nature-and-wildlife/parks-and-gardens/wombat-hill-botanic-gardens">Wombat Hill Botanical Garden</a>. I really loved the way the leaves fallen on the floor were turning yellow and adding such nice contrast in colours along the dirt pathway in there, so I took a moment to try and capture that in a photograph.

<p>What do you think of my photos?</p>
<h2 id="gaming---sea-of-thieves">Gaming - Sea of Thieves</h2>
<p>I started playing a new game with an online friend of mine. The game is called <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The game is pretty cool. You play as a pirate and the objective obviously is to go around looking for treasures and getting involved in a lot of piracy by stealing loot from other players as well.</p>
<p>You sail the seas in a ship that requires other people to be with you to assist with tasks on the ship. Such as someone to captain and steer the ship, someone to manage the sails, someone to fire the cannons and someone to manage any damage to your ship.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty addictive, I will admit. However, they ruined the game by adding loads of micro-transactions that you can purchase with real money which then completely takes away from the game as a whole.</p>
<p>You see, the micro-transactions allow you to purchase cosmetic upgrades to your character, equipment and ship. You would think that this in itself wouldn&rsquo;t ruin a game, as this doesn&rsquo;t make it pay to win.</p>
<p>However, this whole game, there are no skills or levelling involved, and a fresh player has the same abilities and strengths as a veteran player. The whole objective of this game is to loot treasures and make coins, which you can use in supply shops to purchase new cosmetic upgrades to your character, ship and equipment.</p>
<p>So if you go ahead and purchase these with real money, the rest of the game just suddenly becomes boring with no more progression.</p>
<p>This explains also why this game has huge issues with cheats. Even with their so called anti-cheat system.</p>
<h2 id="vibe-coding">Vibe Coding</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a lot of AI to assist me with the coding of this blog. Since I do not have the knowledge to do it all myself.</p>
<p>This week I did more updating to the blog, including adding a new feature that allows my images to be clicked on to load a type of lightbox, enlarged image with alt text showing beneath it.</p>
<p>I also made more updates to the home page where latest posts and replies show. #Hashtags and such will now auto link so that you can search them for recent posts syndicated into <a href="https://mastodon.social">Mastodon.social</a>. Any webmentions and links also work through this page without having to open the individual posts.</p>
<h2 id="daughters-birthday">Daughters Birthday</h2>
<p>My daughter Zoey had her 11th birthday! We went with 10 of us to play some #LaserTag and it was awesome fun. I haven&rsquo;t played laser tag in more than 10 years now and it brought back fond memories.</p>
<p>The kids absolutely loved the day. After laser tag we spent some of the afternoon in the arcade section and earning tickets to spend on sweets and little toys.</p>
<p>We would have done some #GoKarting, but didn&rsquo;t realise it had gotten so expensive! They want $50 now for a session!</p>
<h2 id="sl-colonies">SL Colonies</h2>
<p><a href="https://slcolonies.com">SL Colonies</a> is my Indie Game that I have been developing with a coding friend for more than 6 years. It&rsquo;s an #RPG system with crafting and survival that was made to work within the <a href="https://secondlife.com">Second Life</a> platform. Part of the #metaverse.</p>
<p>Anyway, we finally finished making a full questing system for the game that allows RPG world builders to fully build quests and story-lines from scratch.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see this new system in action by our community!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Every week I get to the recap writing, and always look at what I&rsquo;ve done briefly and think that I am not going to have much to write about - but I seem to always prove myself wrong.
There&rsquo;s always so much to recap on that I enjoy typing and going through what I accomplished and what I did not accomplish.</p>
<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t do a lot of my tasks, such as my daily exercises and meditation and readings, I feel I have still been productive enough all in all.</p>
<p>Ok, while the wording <em>productive</em> might not be the best example, the life experiences are still there. I wouldn&rsquo;t really think twice about what I&rsquo;ve done over the week if I didn&rsquo;t #journal and #microblog about everything on a daily basis, and then write about the whole week. It really puts a different perspective on life and I highly recommend you guys get into it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funner than I thought, that&rsquo;s for sure!</p>

			 <p>Just got home from #LakeDaylesford. Took my mother out for a walk around the lake, and for some sneaky photos of mushrooms, since it is suppose to be that time of year. But, I only found one mushroom! Normally there&rsquo;s heaps! It&rsquo;s been a dry spring, even the local waterfall is dry.</p>

<p>I started off the week with some interesting <em>signs</em> being sent to me throughout the day. Bit hard to put into words, but lets just say that the universe was nudging me at the beginning of the week into a certain direction by continuously sending me signals, or, signs. And they were not just coincidental, here are some examples.</p>
<p>While <em>binge-watching</em> the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/">silo</a> series, it would continue to pause every 30 seconds to 1 minute - making the watching of it a task. I did not think too much about it at first, until it got so annoying that I thought I would try to time the period between pausing to see if there was some kind of pattern to it. Except, every time I went to try to time it and make sense of it, the timer would reach 5 minutes&hellip;. 10 minutes&hellip;. 15 minutes or more and not a single pause.</p>
<p>Every time I would stop timing, the darn thing would pause again. Again, I thought nothing too much of it. I tried internet speed test, my connection was perfectly fine.</p>
<p>This happened more than 10 times. Every time I would try to time it, nothing. I got to a point where I realised what was going on, and I would laugh out loud to myself in my vacant home and just make it do it for kicks&hellip; stop timing it, and then pauses&hellip; time it, no pauses&hellip;</p>
<p>This was not all that occurred though. When I realised this was a sign and decided I needed to get off the PC. I went to have breakfast. I have a Google HUB that displays Google Photos (yes, I know&hellip; Google&hellip;) I added to a collection years ago. And while I was eating breakfast, I would look at the photo frame and for some reason, the photos I was being shown were very specific.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean one or two photos, but half a dozen or so photos in no random order. These were specific photos of me and my family on the way to specific events or at specific events. Different years, different times of years. But all related to specific events to do with <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">Falun Dafa</a> and <a href="https://www.shenyun.com/">Shen Yun</a> etc.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that all of the above got me pretty focused for the rest of the week to do my meditation, to read and to tick off all of my daily tasks. And I accomplished those tasks for the whole week which I am quite proud of. This is the reason you&rsquo;ve been seeing a lot more posts from me about <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">Falun Dafa</a>. And if you&rsquo;re been reading my weeklies, you&rsquo;d have noticed I have been mentioning how much procrastinating I had been doing, and never been truly happy with the lack of tasks I accomplished for myself. Always providing some kind of <em>excuse</em>.</p>
<p>And no, I was not under the influence of magic mushrooms, DMT, LSD or anything at all for that matter. This was very much normal woken state.</p>

<h2 id="world-falun-day">World Falun Day</h2>
<p>We went to the city for <a href="https://faluninfo.net/may13/">World Falun Day</a> on Saturday, which is a Parade that marches through the city to celebrate the beginning of the <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">Falun Dafa</a> teachings in China. I posted about it <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/10/the-world-falun-day-parade.html">here</a> where I included some photos, and then I uploaded some videos of it <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/11/here-are-videos-from-yesterdays.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a much longer video available to watch below which shows the full parade group. I&rsquo;m hidden in there somewhere!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Excuse the shaky video. It wasn&rsquo;t me recording it!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about my practice, there&rsquo;s plenty of information out there. You can also reach out to me privately.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h2>
<p>I made <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/08/ive-been-using-obsidian-to.html">this</a> post which talks about how I have been using Obsidian lately for my journal and how my &ldquo;mycelium&rdquo; network of thoughts has been developing over time and growing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I really like the plugin for micro.blog that allows me to use a token in order to publish directly from Obsidian to my website.</p>
<p>Highly recommend you guys get into this as my workflow can go from just posting thoughts throughout the day into a daily entry, that links to separate notes with hashtags and so forth. I can choose to publish a specific note or just keep it private. But what&rsquo;s neat with tags is that over time, on the larger graph that I display tags on, I can see my interests developing and changing over time. I can then hone in on that specific interest and see if there&rsquo;s enough I have linked to and written about that interest over time, to then create a full fledged article from.</p>
<h2 id="web-tinkering">Web Tinkering</h2>
<p>Last week I tinkered around with my PC. This week I managed to tinker around with my website. I posted about it <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/05/09/ok-while-ticking-away-at.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have been pretty happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>I use to have the main page as just a large About Me, which I felt was just too much information and not straight to the point.</p>
<p>When I visit others blogs, I like to go to the main domain and see the most recent updates, to see if I have missed anything. So that&rsquo;s precisely what I have gone and done with my website now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When you go to my domain <a href="https://samuellison.com">https://samuellison.com</a> you now will see a smaller about section, and then my latest posts and replies to others. They display the markdown, as well as images and video.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an icon which lets you see if it&rsquo;s a reply or a post of my own. And if you click on them, you can then participate in discussion if it is my own post, and if it&rsquo;s a reply, you can follow a link to the original discussion at the original posters location.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty neat, what do you think?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really thought I would not have much to discuss from this week, but reading back above, it looks like I was able to share with you quite a bit!</p>
<p>Again, I hope that you enjoyed reading and learning, and thank you for getting this far.</p>
<p>Now, back to ticking off my tasks!</p>

So, I managed to meditate, skipping/jump rope and reading. I did that just after both my girls completed their private piano tutoring. Now, lets sneak in another episode of #Silo as a reward. 2 more episodes to go, then I need to wait for Season 3 to be released!</p>

<p>I tend to get on the PC with a coffee and get dug into other things that interest me more. But the physical grind is a necessity to reach my other physical goals.</p>
<p>I keep telling myself that a way around this would be to do the tasks first, before jumping onto the PC to do anything else. Why don&rsquo;t I just do that then? What is it that is stopping myself?</p>
<h2 id="silo-series">Silo Series</h2>
<p>In mentioning the above about just getting things done. I can already see where it started. I made <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/i-read-this-article-by.html">this</a> post about a series called #Silo and then off I went, deep into the rabbit whole that is, a great series.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely #dystopian in nature. It takes some of its likeness from the games known as #Fallout and can be seen somewhat similar to the series with the same name. However, there&rsquo;s no <em>fun</em> twists and no blood and guts all over the place.</p>
<p>Silo is much more serious, dark, and much more of a thriller. Focused entirely on the inside of the silo, and not so much the apocalyptic exterior.</p>
<p>In one of the episodes, there is the mention of using something in water, to suppress the peoples memory over a long period of time. Does that remind you of anything still in a majority of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6320968/">our water</a>? Have we forgotten why we added flouride to water in the first place? I mean, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://aquaspace.com/blogs/wow/what-no-one-tells-you-about-fluoride">only a bi-product </a>of our aluminium, steel, cement, phosphate and nuclear weapons manufacturing. But what do I know?</p>
<h2 id="dark-world-of-trafficking">Dark world of Trafficking</h2>
<p>During the week I also made a post about what I believe at least to be another <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/29/pretty-disappointing-really-another-fake.html">fake suicide</a> related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. I don&rsquo;t want to go into detail on my thoughts, and will let you do your own digging, out of respect for the family involved, but I wanted to raise the awareness. Getting hit by a bus and in hospital with serious injuries, only for police to be notified about it a whole day later, and to be told minor injuries only? Then, suddenly, the victim decides after all these years, she&rsquo;s had enough and it&rsquo;s time to end it? No more public outreach, no more talking? And to top it off, strange unidentified men at the house? Not detectives or anything like that (unarmed), but well groomed and obviously&hellip; government or secret service in nature.</p>
<p>The world of human and sex trafficking is dark, and powerful. More needs to be done to unveil all of this and get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>That is all I will say.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-diet">A new Diet?</h2>
<p>Looking back at the week, I made <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/30/if-we-are-as-well.html">this post</a> about going back to a whole foods diet. How am I going with that?
Not real well yet. I have not yet committed to this fully, though I have kept myself aware of it. I am trying to reduce the amount of processed food I rush to when I feel a little hungry. I haven&rsquo;t been successful, as sugars and processed foods are so addictive and I find it one of my biggest weaknesses - especially chocolates.</p>
<p>This is detrimental really, because all the work I try to put in by exercising, hiking and so forth, is negated and just keeping me where I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not overweight or anything like that. I have good strength and cardio fitness. But I really would like to get rid of that stubborn belly fat that lingers, and I know it&rsquo;s mostly from sugars and insulin!</p>
<p>Supermarkets don&rsquo;t help, do they? Long shelf life. Sweet tasting foods made to get you going back for more. Soft drinks.</p>
<h2 id="more-pc-tinkering">More PC Tinkering</h2>
<p><a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/the-weekly-recap-week.html">Last week</a> I shared in my weekly recap some PC tinkering I had been doing. This week, I added to that with some <a href="https://lian-li.com/product/strimer-plus-v2/">Lian Li Strimer </a>cables! I got them for the motherboard, and my graphics card.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think I have completed the whole look of my PC now and am happy where it is at.</p>
<p>All I need now is to just keep it maintained and upgrade as needed when things get too far behind. The next purchase will be to upgrade my NVIDIA 2070 to a 4070 card for my video editing and video recording needs.</p>
<p>The 2070 is still going strong though and the only benefit I will get currently is a cut in processing time when encoding my videos and some extra frame rates when recording my screen in OBS.</p>
<p>I use an external stream box for streaming in 4K and let it handle my streaming, however, the quality is not as high as I could probably get through software encoding in OBS on the PC itself with a more powerful card!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put that to the test eventually, when I do decide that it is time to upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it for this week! I also have a <em>monthly</em> entry to type up, but I don&rsquo;t know yet if I will keep that to myself or post it on my blog. I&rsquo;ll basically be going through my weekly entries and seeing if I mentioned anything that I didn&rsquo;t follow through with and would just be repeats of information I think.</p>
<p>If you like what you read, and enjoy reading these, I do appreciate you letting me know!</p>
<p>Until next week!</p>

			 <p>I umm, ended up watching the whole season 1 of #Silo. And I&rsquo;ve just started watching Season 2. I love it. It&rsquo;s like a much more serious #Fallout. The similarities are there, cannot be denied. Fallout came out in 1997. But a different, more serious dystopian spin that I like just as much.</p>

<p>I had a big week, all things considered. As at the end of this week, we went out all the way to #LakesEntrance as a family. A 4-hour drive each way and loads of activities to do, that the 2 nights were just not enough to get everything done. We definitely have to go back!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In saying that though, having a quick glance at the beginning of the week, and really, as a whole. I did 1 day of my exercise and reading. Once again disappointing myself with my fitness goals, as last week. I can probably forgive myself for the first day, due to it being more of a recovery day from night shift. Looks like I kept myself busy at the start of the week though with a new CPU cooler upgrade and strimer cables for #RGB goodness inside my PC setup. And the end of the week was taken by 3 days on a family trip to Lakes Entrance. Hmm, OK, I can forgive myself here!</p>
<h2 id="pc-tinkering">PC Tinkering</h2>
<p>I have had my PC for a good 15 years now and done some hardware upgrades to it along the way to keep it relevant. Recently updating my PC case as well to be able to see what&rsquo;s inside, although I had never been much of a RGB fan prior.</p>
<p>I think with my new home office setup though, the sit-stand desk that I had custom made and all the other nice nick-nack&rsquo;s to make the room mine, having the PC on display became an objective.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For years, I had this huge Cooler Master CPU cooler, which actually does a great job with its heat sinks. And late last year during summer, I noticed my PC hitting some kind of limitation with tiny system hangs, frame rate limitations and so forth. This was because, not only was it a warm summer, but I was also doing a lot of live streaming which would put more strain on the system.</p>
<p>I decided to give the whole PC a clean by pulling it apart. Assuming the CPU cooler needed dust removed to make it more efficient, I pulled that off of the CPU as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unfortunately I cannot find the photo of this, as it was a while ago and not sure where I saved it, but I noticed I had forgotten to remove the piece of plastic that sits on the copper heat-sink and is suppose to have direct contact with the CPU. The piece of plastic clearly had written on it, &ldquo;<strong>WARNING: Remove before use</strong>&rdquo;. I built the whole PC from scratch, so I can&rsquo;t blame someone else for it! So glad my CPU made it through all those years without overheating!</p>
<p>Removing the sticker improved my system performance significantly and I was off and away back into streaming and making videos for our game <a href="https://slcolonies.com">SL Colonies</a>. But that wasn&rsquo;t before adding a liquid cooled upgrade on my list of things I wanted for the PC.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I went and finally purchased a <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BQWSP2ZP">Corsair iCUE Liquid CPU Cooler</a> this week with an LCD display, and installed it. What do you think? And now the temperatures on the PC hover around 25 and 26 Celsius constantly. I haven&rsquo;t yet had the opportunity to fully stress test the system with heavy CPU workload, but this is nice, and it really compliments the whole look.</p>
<h4 id="ethernet-issues-gone">Ethernet Issues Gone</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to report that my <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/24/so-lately-i-have-been.html">Ethernet issues</a> I had been having for a few months now are gone. I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. I thought it was my <a href="https://system76.com/pop/">Linux distribution</a> causing issues at the kernel level with my Ethernet going to sleep or being managed by the system somehow.</p>
<p>Basically, randomly, my network would die on the PC, and the only way to get it back, was to physically unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it back in. Not even turning Ethernet on and off seemed to work. And it was happening at random times, not just when walking away from the PC; I could be in the middle of working and the network would go offline.</p>
<p>This was an issue, as I need a stable connection for my daily needs. Especially for video calls and live streaming. I also run a <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/">Tor node</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">VM</a> which was being affected.</p>
<p>After much troubleshooting, I was not able to fix it at the motherboard level, and my solution was to purchase a [USB to Ethernet adaptor](<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYTSN18,">www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYT&hellip;</a> which I am happy to report, has remained online during my 3 days away to Lakes Entrance, returning home to a network that has remained online and functioning as expected!</p>
<p>Apparently, Intel NIC&rsquo;s are known to have this issue? Have you come across it?</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<p>I watched two movies during the week that I briefly posted about. Those were <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/">The Social Dilemma</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Bandersnatch was a great movie. It&rsquo;s very unique, like those <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/choose-your-own-ending">novels that you can pick your characters ending</a> by choosing your path. Well, Bandersnatch does that in a movie form, where the path you pick throughout the movie, provides you with multiple different types of possible endings, dead-ends and just fun! I loved it, it felt very&hellip; schizophrenic? Don&rsquo;t do LSD kids, not without intention (and a good sitter)!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Social Dilemma on the other hand, was an eye-opener. I mean, I have already made a lot of changes in my life to move away from Social Media and more into my own identity on the web by following <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> principals. As well as completely <a href="https://proton.me/blog/how-to-de-google">DeGoogling</a> my life - especially on my phone! My phone is practically a brick with the bare minimum apps to suit my <em>needs</em> and nothing more. But I have taken it further, by not just <em>DeGoogling</em>, but also DeApping. So no emails, no social media, no nothing. The phone does two things. Handle phone calls, and messaging (encrypted through my own self-hosted <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> instance). Other than that, my phone is in airplane mode, connected to home WiFi. Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off, all tracking off and running on <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>.  Highly recommend watching this documentary - it will open your eyes.</p>
<h2 id="car-maintenance">Car Maintenance</h2>
<p>I did a little car maintenance on my wife&rsquo;s vehicle. I&rsquo;m not very hands on and definitely not a mechanic, unlike my brother. But I changed some light globes for the headlights and number plates and got my hands dirty. It&rsquo;s an old Toyota Camry Altise - I think 2015 odd? She&rsquo;s getting old, but still very reliable.</p>
<p>Actually need to arrange with my brother to do its shock absorbers, as they&rsquo;ve reached their end-of-life!</p>
<h2 id="voting">Voting</h2>
<p>We had to vote in Victoria for state parliament and local government. I did something different this year, as usually I just vote based on what I know personally, and that&rsquo;s nothing&hellip; as I really am not interested in any politics. But that is the wrong way to vote, and I fear a lot of us vote like I did.</p>
<h4 id="i-used-ai">I used AI</h4>
<p>Yes, you read right. I used AI to help me in making my informed decision. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean that I typed into the prompt, <em>&ldquo;Who do you recommend I vote for?</em>&rdquo; - that would be outright stupid.</p>
<p>But I used AI as a tool to help me make my informed decision, and it performed very well.</p>
<p>Basically, first I got AI to help me setup a score matrix spreadsheet. Where I listed topics that were important to me, not important to me and topics I was against. Each with their own score based on importance to me.</p>
<p>For me, digital privacy, encryption, security, open source solutions and so forth are my top priorities. Among many others of course which I wont discuss here publicly. But AI was able to work a uniquely tailored scoring system for me.</p>
<p>So then, there were 16 parties for me to rank based on my scoring. And AI helped here by writing me, essentially, an essay on each party and their representatives, one by one and scoring with me, giving each party a <strong>total</strong>.</p>
<p>I made sure to look out for any controversial topics. Scoured the web for sources on anything that would raise red flags for me to lower my preferences for a certain person or party.</p>
<p>In the end, I had 16 parties in order of preference that I was able to make informed decisions about to cast my vote.</p>
<p>I would not recommend AI to give you its own opinions about people or parties. Remember that AI is an LLM and gathers its information from the WWW and will base its <em>opinions</em> on others opinions and not your own. Also, remember that opinions can be coded in by those who control the software.</p>
<p>What you need, are sources you can read, watch and listen to.</p>
<p>The process I used took a full day for me with everything else on hold. It was worth it, and I felt better using this method than my old method.</p>
<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a funny video I recommend you watch, just for a laugh:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Funny right?</p>
<h2 id="lakes-entrance">Lakes Entrance</h2>
<p>Over the #AnzacDay long weekend, I took the family out to #LakesEntrance which is a 4 hour drive from #Melbourne and with my Tesla, requires at least one charge on route. This is good though, as it means I take a rest at least every 2 hours and stretch the legs.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about electric vehicles, in my opinion, is that when you do need to charge on a long road trip, you get to leave the car plugged in and all get out of the car to go for a walk, go for a bite to eat in the local town and enjoy the scenery before continuing. I think this in itself will help with the road toll of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We started our trip with a visit of the <a href="https://raymondisland.net/">Raymond Island</a>, which included a trip on the Raymond Island Ferry. The island has hundreds of koalas that you can see while going on walks around. There are some trails marked out on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/south-raymond-island-foreshore-walk">AllTrails</a> you can check out if you like, but you can basically walk anywhere along the Island and you are sure to find koalas all over the place. They were introduced back in 1953 to Raymond Island, from Phillip Island due to the population of Koalas in Australia almost becoming extinct due to not only disasters, but to the fur trade (we humans&hellip;).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We then went for a dinner at a place called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CathysAsianKitchen/"><strong>Cathy&rsquo;s Asian Kitchen</strong></a> in Lakes Entrance. Hidden inside a motel carpark, we found it to be a hidden gem, with authentic and extra-tasty Malaysian Cuisine. Kudo&rsquo;s to the family owners on this one, as we absolutely loved it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next location was the <a href="https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/buchan-caves-reserve">Buchan Caves</a> in Buchan, Victoria. We went into the Fairy Cave and the Royal Cave and those were absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend you go pay those a visit and enjoy the day out there with the family, as there&rsquo;s also a multitude of walking trails to do. You can camp there, bring a caravan (with bookings) and all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video that I managed to record inside the Royal Cave in Buchan. It is essentially a walk-through from the end back to the exit on the way back out, as I was the last in my group with no one behind me to make me have to walk quicker.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the caves, we went for a 2 hour cruise on the waters using <a href="https://www.coastalstays.com/peelscruises/">Peel&rsquo;s Lake Cruises</a>. There are other companies around that offer cruises, and I am sure they are just as good. However we picked this one last minute after lunch and after the caves and this cruise had some spots left for us.</p>
<p>We got to see Fraser Island, Flannagans Island, Rigby&rsquo;s Island, Raymond Island and the beautiful surrounds of the local areas as a whole.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Captain took us to the entry of Lakes Entrance, known as &ldquo;The Entrance&rdquo; where seals are commonly seen sun bathing on the rocks. And that didn&rsquo;t disappoint, as the seals were indeed there having a wonderful time. Here&rsquo;s a video!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On our final day we went to the <a href="https://www.metunghotsprings.com/">Metung Hot Springs</a>. Our kids had never gone to any hot springs before, so this was an experience for them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as big as some of the other hot springs around Victoria, but given that it was not too busy when we went, there&rsquo;s was plenty for us to enjoy. I love the barrels up top with a view of the scenery below!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We could have ended our trip there, considering the 4 hour drive back home, but the kids really wanted to see the beach. So we completed a walk around some of the 90 mile beach. The trail was called the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lakes-entrance-loop-via-90-mile-beach">Lakes Entrance Loop via 90 Mile Beach</a>. This was a beautiful walk with the family - and most important of all, the kids loved it. We got to see the seals again by <em>The Entrance</em> and loads of crabs! Check out these two small videos below:</p>

			 <p>So lately, I have been having issues with my Ethernet port built into my motherboard. It is intel based and has been getting random hangs throughout the day. The only way to get the net back was to unplug and plug back in and the hang would fix itself. Now, I purchased a new UGREEN USB to Ethernet Adapter as a solution. So my #Tor Node and my #OpenSimulator world on the #Metaverse can stay online.</p>

<p>Looking at the whole week, I can already see that my routine was really put out of whack due to #NightShift. I don&rsquo;t know if I am just making excuses up, but it really does feel that way. I was not able to get my sleep pattern right, mostly breaking my 6 to 8 hour sleep period into two cycles. One perhaps within an hour of getting home from work, trying to sleep for 3 to 4 hours, and then waking up for a couple of hours and getting another 2 to 3 hours at the end of the day prior to heading off to work.</p>
<p>During my period of time awake, I really did not feel like doing my daily 30 minutes of skipping, reading, or meditating. I really should have pushed more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say now, at the end of the week and looking back at the daily journal entries - it was a daily mental push to give myself excuses to do other things with my time.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do-for-work">What I do for work</h2>
<p>Not sure I would call it work, as I actually do love my job. I&rsquo;m not sure the English language has any appropriate words for it? If you can help me out here, let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>The only reason I am delving more into this area of my life is because I happened to have discussions with someone in comments of my #thoughts posts on the #fediverse and answering a few questions throughout.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m a police officer where I live, and I really enjoy helping people out when they need it most. I know a lot of us get jaded, joining a dream job only to find the reality of it is not what you think - but it really does take a certain mentality to look at the profession from different angles and to shift your focus from <em>crime centric</em> to <em>victim centric</em> and focusing on helping out the victim, communicating with the victim throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>We are trained when going to a job to focus on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender. A lot of us get stuck in tunnel vision and want the fun stuff, chasing the offender and missing all the initial actions necessary for an investigation to be successful at court. And even more so, a lot of us forget in all of that, about the victim. Focusing only on the desired outcome with the offender.</p>
<p>In the end, that leads to burnout. As this job has tonnes of paperwork involved (at least in Victoria). Focusing on the outcome of the offender only to get a result at court that is essentially a slap on the wrist brings you down - and then, because you never focused on the victim - the victim is wondering what&rsquo;s happened since police arrived - did police do nothing? You as a member now have no rapport with the victim.</p>
<p>If you keep yourself focused on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender, not just at the initial job, but throughout the whole process, you are more likely to enjoy the full process, as is the victim going to understand the process by being spoken to like a human being, remembered and guided throughout. While the outcome at court may be the same result - your mind has been on helping a member of the community understand the process and know the likely outcome. This leads to a member of the community who understands the process we go through, understands the law system a little more, and is more likely to speak up to MP&rsquo;s or within the community about our law system to make desired changes.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is one method I have come to enjoy my line of work in the mountain of paperwork and lack of time to do it.</p>
<p>Another method I have come to keep enjoying it, is #compartmentalising and using my daily journal keeping, and my blogging on my own domain name. Gone are the days of sitting on social media, scrolling an endless feed of algorithmically curated content to drain my stream of consciousness and just <em>consume</em>.</p>
<h2 id="black-mirror">Black Mirror</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another method I kept myself sane during what time I had awake after night shift was to delve into the #BlackMIrror series. Season 7 was released, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist digging in, as I really enjoy this series as someone that doesn&rsquo;t actually watch TV anymore or go down the #YouTube rabbit holes and such.</p>
<p>Season 7 was really well done. I enjoyed every episode in it. I initially thought it would be like Season 6 and out of touch with the rest of the seasons, but this season did not disappoint in any way.</p>
<p>Looking at the world from different aspects of <em>what could</em> be with today&rsquo;s technology, or soon to have technology with a bit of a satanical twist to them really makes for an interesting watch.</p>
<p>The first episode actually had me on a downer! And above I was saying keep myself sane by watching this season? Episode 1 was a drainer and <a href="https://samuellison.com/2025/04/14/043923.html">I thought I&rsquo;d need a psych</a> to reground myself into reality!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into any more detail about it, but you really should take the time out to watch them if you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="ai--llms">AI / LLM&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>Speaking of Black Mirror and technology - this week I felt that the LLM&rsquo;s I had been using for discussions and troubleshooting felt off. #GPT and #DeepSeek were hallucinating information a lot more and spitting out false information to me, leading me down tracks of nonsense.</p>
<p>I was trying to troubleshoot and looking into content management systems that had built in #AcivityPub backends for my website.</p>
<p>Currently, I use micro.blog to host my website, and rely on its backend that enables me to follow people on the fediverse and comment/reply to their content and have discussions. It also enables my posts on my blog to appear on the fediverse and for any replies to end up on my website as well.</p>
<p>Micro.blog allows for the exporting of all posts and what not, which is great! But if I wanted to self-host, as well as keep my fediverse identity (@samuel@samuellison.com) I would also need a system that has an ActivityPub backend that is not just a platform with no ability to customise into a full website like what you are reading from now. I can use Mastodon, Pixelfed, GoToSocial, WriteFreely etc, but none of those offer what I need.</p>
<p>The LLM&rsquo;s were spitting out so much false information that I was down a rabbit hole for 2 hours before I realised this was all nonsense. The LLM&rsquo;s finally admitted that they were wrong when pressed, and that their information was based on &ldquo;<em>theoretical features</em>&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t yet exist!</p>
<p>Could it be that the #AISlop that is appearing more and more on the internet is causing #AI to become more useless when it comes to providing us with information?</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of content these days, including articles, stories, news, videos - are all AI generated by people that are prompting AI to write it. This makes AI gather the information it needs from the internet, assess, and then spit out the work for you.</p>
<p>Then, the next person does the same. AI repeats, gathers its information from itself (from AI generated content already on the web now - repeat) and spits out even more useless information.</p>
<p>Then, you have companies like #CloudFlare, a content delivery network, that attempts to protect its clientele by creating <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/">sophisticated <em>mazes</em></a> where AI is lead down these rabbit holes of information it thinks it is obtaining from legitimate sources, which is actually in itself being created on the fly by other AI technology and feeding the requesting AI/LLM with misinformation.</p>
<p>Have you noticed this starting to happen?</p>
<p>I personally think it&rsquo;s a good thing. I mean, LLM&rsquo;s have been stealing the work of artists and writers now for some time. Why are we going in the direction of AI replacing all our jobs, instead of making AI useful? Where are these AI that can come do my washing, my dishes, my gardening and other duties around the household to enable me to have more free time to do what I enjoy to do during my spare time?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need my job replaced by AI, I&rsquo;m sure none of you do. All this talk of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o"><em>universal basic income</em></a> and the likes. What will we do with our time, if what we enjoy to do is taken by AI? I hope not Episode 2, Season 1 of Black Mirror - <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2089049/">Fifteen Million Merits</a>!</p>
<h2 id="family-visiting">Family Visiting</h2>
<p>I had family visiting from Brisbane during my time doing night shifts. Means I missed out on a lot of opportune family time with members of the family I don&rsquo;t generally get to see on a regular basis, which is a shame. But we did still get a few things done as family where I got to be involved. Including celebrating my father in laws 70th birthday with some wonderful food at #BoardWalkPizzeria in #CarolineSprings.</p>
<p>Also got to celebrate an Easter dinner with the family and cousins and all the kids. We guys played a few board games, including #munchkins and #Catan! My cousin made some beautiful #pizza which we all enjoyed very much!</p>
<h2 id="john-carpenters-they-live">John Carpenter&rsquo;s: They Live</h2>
<p>Saying that I generally don&rsquo;t watch movies is somewhat of a lie. After seeing a post by <a href="https://defcon.social/@n1ghtw1re">@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social</a> suggesting to go watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/">They Live</a> by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/">John Carpenter</a> I went and did just that. I <em>can</em> be swayed into watching movies by those I choose to follow and consume information from - I suppose!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Actually quite a good movie indeed! Made in 1988 and having a Black Mirror kind of vibe where humanity has actually been taken over by an alien race, and we are stuck in this illusionary hypnotised state of consuming information and complying.</p>
<p>Actually there&rsquo;s a line in this movie which is featured in the Duke Nukem games, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I&rsquo;m all outta gum&rdquo;, vs the original movie quote, &ldquo;I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass&hellip; and I&rsquo;m all outta bubblegum&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Actually, the game was somewhat inspired by this movie. Not only in the line, but the hog police (aliens), the whole look of Duke Nukem and more!</p>

			 <p>Something I have been enjoying about the #Fediverse is the ability to follow domains instead of just social accounts. Some creators have both the domain with news articles and a dedicated social network account on things like #Mastodon. But these tend to sometimes get too much, like #GrapheneOS lately. I can keep updated with actual product news by following their domain, and not get all the other stuff that is not relevant to me.</p>

<p>5/6 of the Episodes I have enjoyed greatly. For anyone to think they are not original&hellip; not sure what their perspective is on that. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind knowing!</p>

<p>I want people to read what I write here. I want (hope) to be a familiar face in feed readers. I want to be linked to. The internet is a network and I want to be part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think every blogger goes through this. Webmentions are handy, but now there are ActivityPub integrations that work well and allow your thoughts to be read by followers on the #fediverse directly. #IndieMicroblogging is <a href="https://book.micro.blog/">real</a>.</p>

			 <p>Finally had a full straight #sleep for #NightShift instead of breaking my sleep into 2 sections. Getting use to the routine, but it took half a week, and there&rsquo;s only half to go. Then I go back to normal shifts and have to reset the #bodyclock all over again.</p>

			 <p>I couldn&rsquo;t resist #BlackMirror also watched Episode 4 of Season 7. Interesting to see the new technologies my form of work might get access to in the future. But also interesting the topics touched, #LSD, the language of sounds and light. The world outside of this physical realm we see with our two physical eyes. Isn&rsquo;t that why a lot of coders in silicon valley are into the #microdosing these days? The world of #fungi is an interesting one. Streaming direct from the #muse.</p>

<p>Basically, why don&rsquo;t I do a recap that goes through what I accomplished for the week based on a lot of the daily notes I made and go into more detail, since larger long-form content allows for more characters and space to just let it all out and stretch?</p>
<h2 id="onto-the-recap">Onto the Recap!</h2>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t feel I ticked off enough of my <em>daily tasks</em> such as regular skipping/jump-roping, reading, meditating and what not, I feel like I did have a busy week and a lot of debriefing to do with myself. There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack here and more that I will need to write about, now that I come to think of it.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-i-did">Some things I did</h2>
<h3 id="phillip-island">Phillip Island</h3>
<p>Just at the end of last week, the family and I took off to #PhillipIsland and stayed by a beach house. In one of my notes, I state that I should write more of an article about it, yet, I have not yet done so. I need to add this to my list of things to do!</p>
<p>I did at least make a video of it for the family to see, but nothing public about it to discuss where we went, what it was like out there, what did we see?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Stay-tuned, as I may update this post later when I make the journal entry about our trip as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="an-unsuspected-death">An unsuspected death</h3>
<p>Sometimes life throws you curve-balls, and unfortunately we recently had one of those.</p>
<p>My eldest daughter has been taking #guitar lessons for a while and had this really great elderly teacher who seemed so happy, so healthy. Until one day, he would try to speak, yet no words come out.</p>
<p>The teacher ended up in hospital for a few days. We all assumed something like #Apraxia or something similar that affected the brain and his ability to form words.</p>
<p>In actuality, it was a #melanoma in the chest, a #cancer, that had already taken over and it was too late. The teacher was given a week to live from that diagnosis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did not get to take my daughter to visit the teacher to say her goodbyes, as it was already too late and coma had set in and it would not have been appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="new-ups">New UPS</h3>
<p>I purchased a new #UPS for our #NAS due to power surges happening during the week as well. This should greatly reduce the risk of permanent damage due to surges on the NAS, modem and switches. I&rsquo;ve also set the NAS up to auto shut down when power goes out and the NAS uses battery backup.</p>
<h3 id="vibe-coding---the-new-buzz-word-out-there">Vibe Coding - The new Buzz Word out there.</h3>
<p>I did a little bit of #VibeCoding in #OpenSimulator and worked a little more on #SurvivorCore. Just added some &ldquo;consumable&rdquo; scripts to increase or decrease any survival stats in the game.</p>
<h3 id="kids-homework">Kids Homework</h3>
<p>I found out that my youngest daughter had not been doing her homework properly as she&rsquo;s been more focused on wanting to play #Roblox on grandma&rsquo;s iPad upstairs while her older sister would play on the XBOX.</p>
<p>I went and put some restrictions on the internet to try prevent them playing while I am at work straight after school, and try to get them to focus on doing their chores and homework prior to any games.</p>
<p>Because the kids enjoy their iPads as much as I enjoy my #Linux computing - I&rsquo;ve encouraged them to take photos of their homework and tutoring and send to my mother who does their tutoring, to show the completed work and get daily feedback via video calls and what not.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-job-new-opportunities">A New Job, New Opportunities</h3>
<p>I caught up with an old friend prior to him having to fly to #Canberra for his new job. Was great to catch up.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be gone for 12 to 15 weeks for the training before being brought back here to #Melbourne to do the role he applied for and was a successful applicant for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great when you see friends achieve a goal they had set and get into a dream job they had been trying at for years.</p>
<p>There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, somewhere out there. You just gotta find it.</p>
<h3 id="hiking---werribee-gorge">Hiking - Werribee Gorge</h3>
<p>I went for a #hike to #WerribeeGorge with the girls and this was a lot of fun. I should make a #CaptainsLog post about this as well. Stay tuned for that one as I will make another journal entry there and update this article to point to it to prove it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very proud of my kids for accomplishing this one as it was challenging enough for such youngins.</p>
<h3 id="obsidian-a-new-tool">Obsidian, a new tool</h3>
<p>I also did a lot of playing around on #Obsidian to improve on my #journal workflow. I used it for this article, and am using it now for all my #microblog entries and notes.</p>
<p>It allows me to organise all my thoughts in a map, to publish straight to my website and to the #fediverse as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found I&rsquo;ve been more productive using this tool - though, maybe that&rsquo;s just a feeling? Is writing your thoughts and journal considered a form of procrastination in and of itself? We will see when I look back in a few months, or years, won&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>I get to keep short notes within a larger daily entry. I can look back at the whole week and then make a post like this one to reflect on the whole week - see where I can improve on and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>I can also use it as a link aggregator in my short micro entries. Posting a link of a website I looked at and found interesting, and briefly talk about the subject matter. If I find I am talking about a certain #hashtag over and over, I can see an obvious trend in my current interests and choose to post in more detail about it.</p>
<h2 id="on-to-next-week">On to Next Week</h2>
<p>Anyway, I have more things to do. This was my first weekly recap. I plan to do more - but alas, there&rsquo;s only so much time in a day!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s a little hard to plan for the coming week, due to doing #NightShift at work. Makes it difficult to gather the energy to actually <strong>do</strong> things productively. I know there&rsquo;s a few friend and family dinners planned which I will tick boxes off there and have some social fun. This is actually one of the reasons I dislike working the #graveyard shift.

<p>Last month, I went for a final hike in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge">Lerderderg Gorge</a> basically, at the end of summer. And unfortunately, most of the Lerderderg Gorge hiking trails will be closed over Autumn due to planned burning.</p>
<p>These are done, essentially, to keep us, and the surrounds safe here in Australia by minimising the damage a bush fire causes in the more dangerous and drier months.</p>
<p>So for now, Lerderderg will unfortunately not be on my list of locations for fungi photography until a little later in the year. Hopefully I will be able to find some sturdier species coming into winter though!</p>
<h2 id="where-is-lerderderg">Where is Lerderderg?</h2>
<p>The Lerderderg State park is just north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh">Bacchus Marsh</a> in Victoria, Australia. It is a gorge that has been carved out of the rugged landscape by the Lerderderg River.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In early 1851, the area was reputed to be a hot spot for gold mining, and At its peak saw thousands of diggers arrive looking for the lucrative mineral.</p>
<p>If you are interested in hiking this beautiful location, you can check out the AllTrails entry here: <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit">https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit</a></p>
<h2 id="the-adventure">The Adventure</h2>
<p>In this section of the log, I am going to go on and on about my last hike around the Lerderderg Circuit Track. But, if you want to see and hear it first hand instead of read, you can do so by watching this 3.5 hour video of my hike below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h3>
<p>I set off early in the morning, but due to the weather known to be cooler, I didn&rsquo;t start my hike in the cool or the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>It was early morning and I strapped my <a href="https://www.dji.com/au/osmo-action-5-pro">DJI Action</a> onto my chest to get some Point of View (POV) footage of the entire hike to make a video out of it for those interested. That should be embedded for you above for you to watch. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, let me know in the comments and I will embed from an alternative source!</p>
<p>I brought a <a href="https://rode.com/en/microphones/on-camera/videomic-pro">R0DE VideoMic Pro</a> Microphone as well, linked up with <a href="https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelesspro">Rode Wireless Pro&rsquo;s</a> to capture any sounds with some more detail, as that&rsquo;s something I would also like to increase my skills in, and then I set off down the beautiful trail.</p>
<p>At this time of the year, there&rsquo;s usually no flowing water along the river, so the river crossings are easier and you can keep your feet dry, but I will say that having flowing water along a majority of the hike sets a beautiful sound and scenery to enjoy alongside you - so I will be returning here with flowing water with this new equipment. My first attempt at recording this location was using my <a href="https://makertube.net/w/pySqnnSGD6dAryQ3fcrHNW">mobile phone</a> which while the quality was high, it doesn&rsquo;t leave enough room for editing the colours just right to my own liking.</p>
<p>Here are a few sound recordings that I took along the hike. I hope that you enjoy listening to them as much as I enjoyed the recording of them.</p>

<h3 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h3>
<p>This time around, I felt much fitter than my first attempt. Yes, it was cooler, and that would have helped some, but I also felt my cardiovascular and my fitness in general was up to standard for this hike.</p>
<p>There are a couple scrambles which actually require you to use your hands to hold onto the rocks to help yourself up, but nothing too difficult. You just need to be a little careful if you are like me and like to <a href="https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/">ruck</a> your pack. Basically, I enjoy having a 15kg or more backpack on. Not only due to my requirement for photography equipment, but <a href="https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/">rucking</a> is also a form of exercise and increases my strength needs when hiking, especially when going up and really getting into those leg muscles.</p>
<p>Going down means I have to go slower, and trekking poles are really a necessity, as falls are more likely with a heavier backpack when not careful of the extra weight.</p>
<p>Even climbing sometimes, it requires you to activate your core muscles more and take notice of your centre of gravity point, as leaning back a little too much, you&rsquo;ll find that you struggle to keep a balance!</p>
<p>I wish I already had a heart rate monitor and my handheld GPS tracker, as I would like to wear a strap heart rate monitor that tracks my heart rate along the hike, that I can then overlay across the whole video of the hike. That way, you can get a feel of how easy or how difficult a portion of what I am doing might be, based on my own fitness levels - but I am no athlete!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A smart watch with built in heart rate wont do it for me. New ones aren&rsquo;t what they use to be, in my opinion, and their privacy policies are all as bad as each other, require proprietary software to read data from which these companies data mine you for. I will give what data I want to publish thanks.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-top">The Top</h3>
<p>At the top of the mountain, I was approximately 440 or 450m above sea level. I wouldn&rsquo;t be grading the difficulty of a hike or climb based on how high up a mountain is though. The difficulty is determined by the incline, or, steepness of the hike up, whether it requires a lot of scrambling and how long the steep inclinations go for.</p>
<p>You could have a 2,000m mountain with a slight slope that you walk for an hour easily, vs a 100m mountain that has a 50 degree incline that will give you more of a challenge. It&rsquo;s like a slow jog vs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">HIIT</a> training.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain, I took the opportunity to enjoy a small break - re-energised myself with some food and prepared myself for the downward section of the mountain.</p>
<h2 id="the-easy-part">The Easy Part</h2>
<p>The walk down was enjoyable. Heart rate back to normal, the sweat on my back cooling me down as the sun rose higher into the skies.</p>
<p>I made it back in time to get home, have a shower and pick up the girls from school.</p>
<p>The next fun part of the whole hike was to edit all the footage I took of my video and audio and upload it to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/samuellison">ko-fi</a> account for subscribers to download for free if they wish it (or pay what they like).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear about your adventures!</p>

<p>After some discussion, I have put some restrictions on the XBOX to prevent both the girls from playing anything on it from 3pm to 6pm after school if I am not at home, as it seems that when both my wife and I are at work, the kids will rush to get to Grandmas' iPAD and run upstairs to the XBOX to play Roblox together.</p>

<p>Recently, I have had a fascination with wanting to try out hiking in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of reading about night hiking and what the <a href="https://unlockoutdoors.com/benefits-of-night-hiking/">benefits</a> might be, including being able to stay cooler in the summer heat, experiencing the fascinating sounds of the nocturnal wildlife, and seeing the night sky up above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There‚Äôs something magical about hiking in nature at night. You just can&rsquo;t replicate the sights and the sounds of a nightime hike in the daytime. It&rsquo;s a fantastic way to reflect after a frantically busy day.&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve also been looking into the various <a href="https://flyfreshflight.com/is-hiking-at-night-dangerous/">dangers</a> that come along with hiking at night too. In Australia (at least in Victoria), we don&rsquo;t have predatorial animals that are interested in humans, so the most common dangers are going to do with the lack of visibility, and these include your poor visibility, which increases your risk of getting lost and increases your risk of having trips and falls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It‚Äôs also easier to get lost when you‚Äôre hiking at night. The lack of light can make it difficult to see landmarks, and you may not be able to see the trail as well. If you do get lost, it‚Äôs important to stay calm and retrace your steps. If you‚Äôre unable to find your way back, call for help.&quot;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Well, on Monday the 10th of March 2025, I finally got to experience hiking in the darkness!</p>
<p>My wife and I checked our weather app and it was going to be a scorcher. That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky.</p>
<p>Initially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.</p>
<h2 id="the-experience">The Experience</h2>
<p>So there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at <a href="https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park">Werribee Gorge</a>, about to do the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track">Long and Short Circuit Track combined</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark.</p>
<p>While I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.</p>
<p>The torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you&rsquo;d like to check out the torch, it&rsquo;s a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on <a href="https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam.</p>
<p>I also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet!<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Another thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there&rsquo;s plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.</p>
<h3 id="strange-sounds">Strange Sounds</h3>
<p>While commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that&rsquo;s how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.</p>
<p>I was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don&rsquo;t know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-came-the-next-challenge">And then came the next challenge.</h3>
<p>You see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below.</p>
<p>Putting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.</p>
<h3 id="serene-views--wildlife">Serene Views &amp; Wildlife</h3>
<p>On the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.</p>
<p>As the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a <a href="https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system">filtration system</a>, of course), and you&rsquo;re actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it&rsquo;s a much sought after resource!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It&rsquo;s got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn&rsquo;t too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!</p>
<p>We finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Would I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let&rsquo;s see if we can tackle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge">Lerderderg Gorge</a> and I will let you all know how that goes!</p>
<p>And then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below.
What&rsquo;s your experience hiking in the darkness? Have you done it before? Would you do it again? If you haven&rsquo;t done it before, would you consider giving it a go?</p>

<p>While I have been a member of both the <a href="https://secondlife.com">SecondLife</a> and <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSimulator</a> platforms for some time, let&rsquo;s say, 16 years on Second Life, and 1 good year on OpenSimulator, it did not actually hit me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a> was already here with us until <a href="https://about.meta.com/">Meta&rsquo;s</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> wanted to create his own branded &ldquo;<a href="https://about.meta.com/metaverse/">Metaverse</a>&rdquo; to rule them all.</p>
<p>There was talk about Second Life briefly being the answer to the metaverse, but in reality, it does not tick all the boxes (think proprietary, centralized)</p>
<p>And then, I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>, and learned about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indieweb</a> and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">Small Web</a> movements, and it became much clearer to me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="opensimulator-the-metaverse">OpenSimulator, the Metaverse</h2>
<p>So, why do I consider OpenSimulator to tick all the boxes when it comes to being more along the lines of what the metaverse should truly be?</p>
<p>After being a member of the Fediverse for a few months now and learning about <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-decentralized-social-media/">decentralization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> and all those fancy words, I came to realise that the OpenSimulator platform, which seems from the outside to be just a clone of SecondLife, is actually the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is Free and Open Source Software (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a>), and secondly, and most importantly, it is completely decentralized. Allowing people to create their worlds (think, rooms) and connect them to existing grids (think, servers).</p>
<p>So, not only can you host your own worlds on an existing grid and create an account and personal identity on that grid (or server), but you also have the ability to do it yourself, host your own grid with as many worlds as you wish, and connect it to what is known as the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid">Hypergrid</a>, and still be interconnected between all the different worlds, grids and so forth.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Region</strong> = World, or, Planet</li>
<li><strong>Grid</strong> = Server, or, Universe</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add a planet to someone else&rsquo;s universe, or you can create your own universe with your own rules and connect it, or not, to the Metaverse, or, Multiverse, officially known as the Hypergrid.</p>
<p>And it will always be there, no matter what happens to the rest of the universes (grids) out there.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do?</h2>
<p>I decided to host my own Region (or World) and connect it to the Grid (Universe) known as <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> which allows registered users to connect their own regions to their grid, at no cost (besides of course your own hosting costs).</p>
<p>This means, I used an existing avatar account to make the owner of my region and self-host it!</p>
<p>By default, region sizes are setup in the OpenSimulator configuration as 256x256 meters (which is also the size of regions on Second Life). It&rsquo;s actually possible to run much larger region sizes, or to host multiple regions together and place them next to each other to suits your needs.</p>
<p>In my case, I am running a single region, the size of 4x4 (16) regions. Basically, 1024x1024m in land size, and I can do whatever I like with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently bare though, and here&rsquo;s a screenshot of it in its current state.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on">What am I working on?</h2>
<p>I want to build a world based off of 28 Years Later. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/3iiyYkKXpxk">trailer</a> yet, I highly recommend that you do.</p>
<p>I love the idea of having a city which is going through a Zombie Apocalypse and the player having to fight their way through an infested city by smacking zombie NPCs and gathering resources, until they come across a stranded island that appears to be a safe-haven.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This safe-haven will be a village with roles for people to take on and to live their merry lives on. Roles might include things like farmers, smiths, carpenters and hunters. Hunters would go out back into the city, looking for valuable resources, such as metals, more foods, ammunition and medicines.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A fun survival style game.</p>
<p>How do you accomplish that on the Metaverse? Are you able to code?</p>
<h3 id="yes-you-can-code-on-the-metaverse">Yes, you can code on the Metaverse!</h3>
<p>Not only can you build your world with 3d mesh models and materials, in my case, assets I purchased from the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">Unity Asset Store</a> and converted them into usable formats using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a>; but you can code anything your heart desires in OpenSimulator (and yes, in Second Life too).</p>
<p>Both OpenSimulator and Second Life have their own scripting languages.</p>
<p>Second Life uses the <a href="https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal">Linden Scripting Language (LSL)</a> and OpenSimulator has a highly expanded, yet similar language known as <a href="">OpenSimulator Scripting Language (OSSL)</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of code so you can see how easy it is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>default {
    touch_start(integer num) {
        key player = llDetectedKey(0); // Get the avatar's key
        string playerName = llDetectedName(0); // Get the avatar's name

        // Send registration request to the data server
        llRegionSay(12345, &quot;Register|&quot; + (string)player + &quot;|&quot; + playerName);

        // Notify the player directly
        llSay(0, &quot;Registration request sent, &quot; + playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You can view more of my source that I have been working on within my <a href="https://github.com/TemujinCalidius/SurvivorCore">GitHub Repository</a>!</p>
<p>This is just a registration board that players can click on to register their avatar as a player in the system I am working on, but there&rsquo;s way more to do - such as having a HUD and floating text above avatars that tracks the players current survival stats, such as Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Infection as well as a multitude of other things, such as Inventory slots, Coins/Money and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-one-visit">How does one visit?</h2>
<p>To visit places on the OpenSimulator metaverse, you need a virtual world viewer.
And you need the version that allows connection to multiple grids and not just the default Second Life proprietary grid.</p>
<p>The best browser currently is the <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/">Firestorm</a> viewer.</p>
<p>You will need the OpenSimulator version which you can grab from here: <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/">https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/</a></p>
<p>There is support for Windows, Mac and Linux versions. I am using Linux and it works fine.</p>
<p>You can visit my land and come say hello when I am there, by adding the <a href="https://www.osgrid.org/">OSGrid</a> option to your logins (by clicking on &ldquo;<strong>Click to add more grids</strong>&rdquo;, creating an account through the browsers &ldquo;<strong>Create an Account</strong>&rdquo; link and logging in.</p>
<p>Once you are in, open your world map in the view and search for &ldquo;counterearth&rdquo;. I will probably rename the region later to something that matches the RP game I wish to make and update this article when that is done.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not much to see in my world currently, but I endeavour to post more updates on my proceedings and discuss the scripts I have come up with in further articles - so be sure to add this RSS to your reader to keep getting updates on my posts!</p>
<p>I hope that this has also inspired you into looking into the Metaverse and seeing how you could contribute with your coding knowledge to make the experience better for everyone out there! I believe the GitHub repository for OpenSimulator can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/opensim/opensim">https://github.com/opensim/opensim</a> and is coded in the C# language.</p>
<p>Have fun all!</p>

<p>Last night, my family and I attended the <strong>Shen Yun 2025</strong> performance at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre. It was the 6 PM session on Saturday, 15th February 2025, and the venue was packed to capacity. In fact, extra seats had to be released to accommodate the overwhelming demand‚Äîa testament to the growing popularity of this incredible show.</p>
<p>This was my fourth time attending Shen Yun, and I can confidently say it gets better every year. The artistry, storytelling, and sheer skill of the performers left me in awe once again. Shen Yun is not just a dance performance; it‚Äôs an immersive journey into Chinese traditional culture, told through a series of captivating stories. Each dance is a narrative, often inspired by the principles of <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>‚Äîa spiritual practice that emphasises <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the story of &ldquo;Enlightenment,&rdquo; which deeply resonated with me. It followed an army commander grappling with the aftermath of a battle, seeking redemption through spiritual cultivation. The tale was both moving and thought-provoking, reminding me of the challenges we all face in overcoming distractions and attachments in our lives.</p>
<p>Shen Yun also touches on profound themes, including the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners in China. Since 1999, the practice has been banned under the communist regime, which views large, independent movements as a threat. Some of the stories depicted the harsh realities faced by practitioners, including imprisonment and even organ harvesting‚Äîissues that remain under scrutiny on the global stage.</p>
<p>While Shen Yun has faced challenges in Australia, particularly in Victoria, this year‚Äôs performance felt like a turning point. The messaging was more subtle, focusing on the dangers of atheism and the importance of staying true to one‚Äôs faith or tradition. It was a refreshing approach that seemed to resonate with the audience, regardless of their personal beliefs.</p>
<h2 id="a-journey-through-stories-and-values">A Journey Through Stories and Values</h2>
<p>Shen Yun‚Äôs performances are structured as a series of short stories, each with its own unique message and artistic flair. The dances are accompanied by a live orchestra that blends traditional Chinese instruments with Western symphonic elements, creating an unforgettable auditory experience.</p>
<p>One of the standout stories for me was &ldquo;Enlightenment.&rdquo; It begins with an army commander surveying the devastation of a battlefield. Overcome with guilt, he contemplates suicide but is stopped by a Buddhist abbot, who guides him toward spiritual cultivation. The commander renounces his attachments and joins a monastery, where he faces tests of his resolve. From temptations of wealth and power to the distractions of worldly desires, the story mirrors the struggles we all face when trying to meditate or focus on self-improvement.</p>
<p>The commander‚Äôs ultimate success in achieving enlightenment was beautifully portrayed, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and inspiration. It‚Äôs a story that lingers in your mind, encouraging introspection long after the performance ends.</p>
<h2 id="the-subtle-evolution-of-shen-yun">The Subtle Evolution of Shen Yun</h2>
<p>As a <strong>Falun Dafa practitioner</strong>, I‚Äôve noticed how Shen Yun has evolved over the years. Earlier performances leaned heavily into the spiritual aspects of Falun Dafa, which may have felt overwhelming to some Western audiences. This year, however, the messaging was more balanced. The focus shifted toward universal values and the dangers of losing touch with spirituality, making it more accessible to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The show‚Äôs ability to convey these messages through art is what makes it so special. It‚Äôs not just about promoting Falun Dafa; it‚Äôs about encouraging people to reflect on their own values and traditions, whatever they may be. This subtlety was a welcome change and, in my opinion, a step in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="a-call-to-explore">A Call to Explore</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôve never experienced Shen Yun, I highly recommend attending when it comes to your city. It‚Äôs more than just a performance‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity to connect with timeless values and immerse yourself in a rich cultural tradition. For more information about Shen Yun, visit <a href="https://www.shenyun.com/">https://www.shenyun.com/</a>.</p>
<p>For those curious about <strong>Falun Dafa</strong>, I encourage you to explore it at your own pace. There are no memberships, ceremonies, or obligations‚Äîjust a chance to learn and grow through the principles of <strong>Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance</strong>. You can find more information at <a href="https://en.falundafa.org/">https://en.falundafa.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Shen Yun 2025 was a night to remember, and I‚Äôm already looking forward to next year‚Äôs performance. It‚Äôs a reminder of the beauty of art, the power of storytelling, and the importance of staying true to our values in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p>Hiking has become a cherished activity for me, and it‚Äôs even more special when shared with loved ones. Two days ago, I embarked on a hike with my mother through the <strong>Whipstick Loop Walk</strong>, located in <strong>Blackwood, Victoria</strong>, within the <strong>Wombat State Forest</strong>. This 5.8 km loop trail, which takes about two hours to complete, is a relatively easy and scenic walk, perfect for someone like my mother, who is rediscovering hiking after decades.</p>
<p>The trail is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from ferny rainforests near the river to classic Australian bushland with towering eucalypts. It‚Äôs a sensory delight, with the crunch of debris underfoot, the fresh smells of eucalyptus and ferns, and the melodic calls of native birds.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-day">Preparing for the Day</h3>
<p>We set out on <strong>Friday, 14th February 2024</strong>, a pleasant summer day with a temperature of 23¬∞C. I picked up my mother at 8:00 am, and we arrived at the trailhead by 9:00 am. The previous day‚Äôs light rain had left the trail floor scattered with leaves and twigs, adding to the charm of the walk.</p>
<p>Given my mother‚Äôs age (65+) and her recent return to hiking, I carefully chose this trail for its gentle inclines and stable footing. It‚Äôs a great option for beginner hikers or those easing back into the activity. You can find more details about the trail on <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/whipstick-loop-walk">AllTrails</a>.</p>
<h3 id="wildlife-encounters">Wildlife Encounters</h3>
<p>About halfway through the walk, we were thrilled to spot a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala"><strong>koala</strong></a> perched on a young gum tree. It was munching on leaves and scratching itself‚Äîa behaviour I later learned is a way for koalas to spread their scent. Here‚Äôs the photo I captured:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Later, as we neared the three-quarter mark of the trail, we were treated to another magical moment. Four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_boobook"><strong>southern boobook owls</strong></a> flew by, and one landed on a branch right in front of us. I managed to snap a photo of it as it turned its head in a near 270-degree spin. These owls are Australia‚Äôs smallest and most common owl species. Here‚Äôs the image:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-trails-beauty">The Trail‚Äôs Beauty</h3>
<p>One of the things I love most about the Whipstick Loop Walk is its variety. The trail transitions from lush rainforest-like areas near the river to classic Australian bushland as you gain elevation. The eucalypts here bear the marks of bushfires and strong winds, creating a dramatic and rugged landscape.</p>
<p>Although it‚Äôs summer and not the ideal season for fungi, I couldn‚Äôt help but reminisce about my previous visits during autumn. The decomposing logs and damp conditions then bring out stunning mushrooms, perfect for photography. On this trip, I didn‚Äôt bring my professional camera, but I did snap some of my favourite fungi photos on past visits. Here‚Äôs one of a cluster of red mushrooms I captured with my trusty <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000"><strong>Nikon D7000</strong></a>, a 14-year-old camera that still delivers stunning results:</p>

<h3 id="reflections">Reflections</h3>
<p>The hike was a wonderful experience, not just for the natural beauty but for the time spent with my mother. She worked up a sweat by the end, but the cool forest temperatures (ranging from 14¬∞C to 19¬∞C) kept the exertion manageable. It‚Äôs heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and I‚Äôm grateful for these moments we share.</p>
<p>I plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.</p>

			 <p>To my fellow #privacy focused individuals. I&rsquo;ve been using a #Fitbit for some time, and as you are aware, #Google purchased the brand a while ago now, and I have been #De-Googling my life.</p>
<p>What solutions have you found for #fitnesstracking? I&rsquo;d be interested to know about any #OpenSource tracking options that work well with GPS and hiking apps such as #Alltrails, or other alternatives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m new to this area of privacy! Beyond just taking the tracker off completely and going without.</p>

			 <p>This post is basically a re-post of some of my favourite photos so that you are able to find them.</p>
<p>When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.</p>
<p>Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.</p>
<p>Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a <strong>Nikon D7000</strong> while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I will make all of these photos available on my <a href="https://https://www.patreon.com/thesporetrail">Patron</a> page for FREE. You can become a member for free and download all of these in their original format.</p>
<p>They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.</p>
<p>I am sure that you will enjoy these. Please let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Interesting. Though when it comes to WiFi and Bluetooth, make sure that you also turn off WiFi and Bluetooth scanning, as those run in the background even with WiFi and Bluetooth off and allow your devices to be found.</p>

<p>[youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWJ91k4PBjs%5D">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the video, the little boy runs towards his father, who is filming him, in thick snow with only his shoes and underpants on, at times crying bitterly.</p>
<p>As he stands shivering in the cold, he is seen pleading with his father &lsquo;Please give me a hug!</p>
<p>On several occasions, both parents tell their son to lie down in the snow, which he does eventually when his mother presses him.</p>
<p>The film - posted online by his father, surnamed He, who comes from the eastern city of Nanjing - has been viewed by tens of thousands of people on various video-sharing websites and has caused outrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with this&hellip; We should give children a happy childhood, those terrible parents say they do this for their child&rsquo;s own good, but I think their purpose is just to be able to brag in the future,&rdquo; one netizen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t support this, poor kid, does the kid&rsquo;s mother let the father do whatever he wants to do?&rdquo; another person said on Sina&rsquo;s popular weibo microblogging service.</p>
<p>He has been given the nickname of &ldquo;Eagle Dad&rdquo; in reference to Chua, who sparked controversy when she wrote a book extolling the benefits of tough parenting.</p>
<p>His personal assistant, surnamed Xin, said He was on holiday with his family in New York during the Lunar New Year holiday last month, and decided to see in the Year of the Dragon with this unusual method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child agreed and before the run, he did half an hour of slow running to warm up,&rdquo; she said by phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child has received all sorts of forms of training since he was small. When he was one, he started swimming in water that was 21 degrees Celsius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said that the boy was born prematurely with several health problems including water in the brain that prompted doctors to say he may have cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now he has no problems,&rdquo; she said, attributing this to He&rsquo;s intense education method.</p>
<p>One person on Sina&rsquo;s weibo said teaching one&rsquo;s child about the cold and fortitude was a good thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if this method becomes a feature of everyday life, then the child&rsquo;s life learning process is just cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin said He had disregarded the flood of online criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he doesn&rsquo;t care what others say&hellip; that the fact that the child lived showed that he has tenacious vitality,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Tough &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; parenting methods have come under the spotlight recently, as children are increasingly forced to study hard at the expense of leisure activities to succeed in a job market that has become hugely competitive.</p>

			 <p>Received 4 missed phone calls for work this morning to start at 6am for a morning shift. Being as lazy as I am I missed those called. Is that a good thing? I had already planned to go to gym and do my weight training routing.</p>
<p>I think that is something about my personality. I don&rsquo;t mind working, though on-call I dislike last minute plans. When something is in my mind, I set to it and go for it.</p>
<p>So, I went to gym this morning for a Shoulder and Traps workout after eating some nice raisin toast for breakfast:</p>
<p>3 sets x 5 reps of each:
12kg Dumbell Shoulder Press (Cuban)
18kg Dumbell Row (Upright)
12kg Dumbell Raise (Lateral)
35kg Barbell Shoulder Press (Military)
100kg Barbell Shrugs
10kg Dumbel Raise (Front Incline Bench)
16kg Dumbell Row (Shoulder Prone)
35kg Dumbell Shrug (Incline Bench)</p>
<p>I was going to do my usual Muay Thai class tonight, but I got myself an afternoon shift starting at 4pm this evening.</p>
<p>Yesterday I enrolled to complete my Diploma of Food Science &amp; Technology (Nurtition Stream), so I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>

			 <p>Just had a mad workout. I went for a run &amp; straight to Xplode gym with my friend Dinh. We did a few light weights with fast reps, then hit the boxing section for 3 rounds on the bags, followed by some basic drills. Lots of fun, and I am very proud of myself.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, when I got to my girlfriends house, I saw her doing some push-ups for practice&hellip; I am so proud.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John opens the Muay Thai gym back up tomorrow, I can&rsquo;t wait!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
