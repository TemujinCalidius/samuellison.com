<p>Wow, it’s the new year already. When was the end of the world meant to be? 2012?   <br>Show me a sign…</p>  <p>Anyway, I just got back from my morning run. I ran for 3km before coming back home to do a couple push-ups &amp; sit-ups. Now I am sipping on a fresh glass of orange juice.</p>  <p>I went to my gym yesterday at 1pm &amp; done some cardio-boxing workouts. 3xSkipping, 3xShadow, 3xBags &amp; some gut work. Very light workout, but looking forward to turning it up a little at 12pm today.</p>  <p>I wish to be in top form for Vietnam, so all I need to do there is light exercises during my holiday to stay in shape.   <br>Maybe I will find a traditional Vietnamese martial arts gym. I think they call it Nhat Nam, but not sure it’s my thing. It’s very influenced by kung-fu &amp; it differs greatly from what I have studied.     <br>I think perhaps just some jump rope &amp; a boxing bag will suffice me greatly.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/TR-zFe2MYqI/AAAAAAAAAJg/XrQQTONyV7s/s1600-h/Co_Nhat_Nam_1%5B2%5D.jpg"><img title="Co_Nhat_Nam_1" border="0" alt="Co_Nhat_Nam_1" src="https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/b799c723fc.jpg" width="244" height="172"></a></p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
