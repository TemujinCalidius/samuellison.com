<p>I had a wonderful day yesterday with Dao, my one &amp; only. I don’t know what I would do without her &amp; all of her support.</p>  <p>We went to watch ‘The Tourist’ last night, good movie.</p>  <p>I love looking at her smile, knowing that she is happy &amp; giving off positive energy.</p>  <p>I am grateful for being with this most beautiful woman who loves me, cares for me &amp; truly respects &amp; supports me for who I am. Dao brings happiness into my heart.</p>  <p>Forget what other men say about women; once you know you have the feeling of love in your heart, nothing can stop you.</p>  <p>Many will never experience this same feeling as me. Because for one year now this feeling of love has remained between us, and nothing can bring us apart. </p>  <p>Love is ultimate happiness in whatever you have, are with, or are doing in life. With love, you can accomplish anything.</p>  <p>All the haters that have never experienced it, will never understand, nor live great lives.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
