<p>Been going to the gym hard out all week, although I took a night off yesterday as I slept through it. My body must have had enough &amp; too little energy. Need to make sure to eat the right foods that can provide energy throughout the day, not just simple sugars that give you an hour boost, then all of a sudden, nothing.</p>  <p>I done some major core workouts 2 nights ago with my friend Dean. Over 120 push-ups &amp; 120 sit-ups.</p>  <p>Now I am sitting at home a little bored &amp; wondering what to do whilst waiting on some washing to complete. It’s a little too hot &amp; stuffy to clean the bathroom.</p>  <p>Tonight at 5pm I will be doing some light sparring – that will be fun. And tomorrow, more training and light sparring with Dean.</p>  <p>On other details, I am booking a night out at a vineyard in the Macedon Mountains for Dao &amp; I which should be both relaxing &amp; fun. We have never had the opportunity to have time completely alone with each other since we met more than a year ago now.    <br>We will be out in the country, enjoying the fresh air, a 3 course dinner &amp; breakfast in the morning.</p>  <p>Also I look forward to our time together in Vietnam. Instead of just being with Dao’s family, we will also be spending some time alone at a tourist resort by the finely sanded beach. This will be a whole lot of fun &amp; romantic.</p>  <p>Anyway, I need to look carefully into setting myself up a diet, which will enable me to store plenty of energy to burn throughout the day. Perhaps even gain me another 5kg or so.   <br>I wouldn’t mind hitting 75kg for my height and build.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
