Just had a mad workout. I went for a run &amp; straight to Xplode gym with my friend Dinh. We did a few light weights with fast reps, then hit the boxing section for 3 rounds on the bags, followed by some basic drills. Lots of fun, and I am very proud of myself.<br><br>Also, when I got to my girlfriends house, I saw her doing some push-ups for practice... I am so proud.<br><br>John opens the Muay Thai gym back up tomorrow, I can't wait!<br><br>- Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone<br><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
