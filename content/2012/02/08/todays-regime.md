Received 4 missed phone calls for work this morning to start at 6am for a morning shift. Being as lazy as I am I missed those called. Is that a good thing? I had already planned to go to gym and do my weight training routing.

I think that is something about my personality. I don't mind working, though on-call I dislike last minute plans. When something is in my mind, I set to it and go for it.

So, I went to gym this morning for a Shoulder and Traps workout after eating some nice raisin toast for breakfast:

3 sets x 5 reps of each:
12kg Dumbell Shoulder Press (Cuban)
18kg Dumbell Row (Upright)
12kg Dumbell Raise (Lateral)
35kg Barbell Shoulder Press (Military)
100kg Barbell Shrugs
10kg Dumbel Raise (Front Incline Bench)
16kg Dumbell Row (Shoulder Prone)
35kg Dumbell Shrug (Incline Bench)

I was going to do my usual Muay Thai class tonight, but I got myself an afternoon shift starting at 4pm this evening.

Yesterday I enrolled to complete my Diploma of Food Science &amp; Technology (Nurtition Stream), so I'm happy about that.
