Today I purchased a diary &amp; promised myself to keep a record from now on about my day to day life.<br>Training, thoughts &amp; feelings, good &amp; bad times &amp; everything else on my mind.<br><br>I will share with the public some of the things which I feel I can share with others. But otherwise, my hand written diary will contain my most secret and sensitive of thoughts.<br><br>Subscribe to this blog to get updates about me and my life in this new chapter of the 'Making of a Warrior' and follow my footsteps as I share with you my experiences, photos and more.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
