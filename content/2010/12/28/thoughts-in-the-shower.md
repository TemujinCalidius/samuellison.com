This morning as I was having my shower, thoughts were going through my mind.<br><br>I already know that I am fully addicted to training martial arts, in particular Muay Thai. But am not sure if the thoughts I have going through my mind day in and day out are normal...<br>Everywhere I am, no matter if at work, out shopping, spending time with my girlfriend, or out at a family event, I am always thinking about training. Whether it be sparring, fighting on the ring, or defending myself on the street.<br><br>Yes, even when I am laying in bed ready for sleep, training is still going through my mind.<br><br>So what is my passion in life?<br><br>I have worked in the same industry for 7 years of my life, and I am studying Food Science &amp; Technology, which is relevant to my career. Yet, I never think about work when I go home, or think about the future there...<br>I think about Muay Thai...<br>Is my future to continue training, earn a trainers singlet &amp; perhaps become a personal trainer?<br><br>I suppose that time will tell...<br><br>- Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone<br><br><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
