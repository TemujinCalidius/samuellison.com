First day of hard training down. Went to work as usual from 5am until 4pm. Had a quick bite to eat, shower and straight off to training by 5pm. <br><br>After 3 hours of training I was home by 8:30pm and well exhausted.<br><br>Let's see how I go with the rest of the week. <br><br>A little tired this morning, but that is because I did not eat an appropriate dinner nor breakfast following training.<br><br>Lessons learnt and much more to go.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
