<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/shankulkarny@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@shankulkarny</a></span> Not as lonely out there as you think. Iâ€™ve found the indieweb has brought me back my feelings of what social media should be. The people that read and respond, more genuine.</p>
<p>If I post on Facebook, or X - I get nothing. They are people endlessly scrolling for something to do, looking at their phones out in public due to anxiety of being around others looking at their phones.</p>
<p>A blog post, like yours, is read by people who subscribe to your RSS, unknown to you, lurking, reading and enjoying every word.</p>
