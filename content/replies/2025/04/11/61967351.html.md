<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/claralistensprechen5th@friendica.rogueproject.org" class="u-url mention">@claralistensprechen5th</a></span> yeah, I am replying and reading through micro.blog and there is a link to “conversation” which I can click and see the whole conversation and should have done that initially before responding. I am new to this #fediverse thing :D</p>
<p>Maybe replies shouldn’t automatically show up in all your followers feeds by default as they are not really part of that specific conversation.</p>
