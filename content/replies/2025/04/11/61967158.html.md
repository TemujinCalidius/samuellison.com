<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/unusnemo@friendica.rogueproject.org" class="u-url mention">@unusnemo</a></span> same boat here. Annoying that all I see in my timeline is a response to someone’s post. Because I follow you and not the OP. I either have to click directly on your response or click on “conversation” (in micro.blog) to open the full thread, or at least, what’s loaded on this instance.</p>
<p>Confusing, if you ask me.</p>
<p>It’s like listening in to your conversations and not actually being a part of it - then jumping in!</p>
