<p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> indeed. I havenâ€™t been able to find any open source solutions available that allows that though and allows for self-hosting. Micro.blog is the closest thing. It would not be easy to just export out of Micro.blog and keep my fediverse identity going at the same time with all the backend work Micro.blog does on ActivityPub I think. Easy to keep the content, but not the fediverse side, timeline, follows etc.</p>
