<p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> Well thought out post. I felt exactly the same way about Mastodon.</p>
<p>I have my own instance, and I also use micro.blog and was “Syndicating” to my Mastodon instance.</p>
<p>But then, what is the point, when I can just use my own domain name and my fediverse identity created through Micro.blog? <span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/samuel@samuellison.com" class="u-url mention">@samuel</a></span>.</p>
<p>So I used the Migration tool on my Mastodon instance to let people know which account they should be following.</p>
<p>Yes, I lose my posts on the instance - but thankfully I’ve been using micro.blog for a while now and was cross-posting. Which means I have all the original posts still on my website and backed up to github and able to move where I wish, should I ever need to.</p>
<p>Owning your own content has never been more important than now.</p>
