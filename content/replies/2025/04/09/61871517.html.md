<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> What’s keeping you from getting the last part done? Are you open to using any AI, even if it’s just it giving you “tips” on how to improve it a tad more but not change your words. Instead of using AI to do the thing for you, use it to look over it and provide you tips?</p>
