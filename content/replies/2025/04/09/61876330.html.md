<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/tek@freeradical.zone" class="u-url mention">@tek</a></span> not sure how these bug bounty programs work. But I’d be disclosing it without getting into too much detail as to the “how to” and let their reputation take a hit for not taking action on something so serious. With data breaches and the likes being such big news, negligence on their part doesn’t look good now does it?</p>
