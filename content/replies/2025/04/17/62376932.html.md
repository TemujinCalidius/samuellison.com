<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/n1ghtw1re@defcon.social" class="u-url mention">@n1ghtw1re</a></span> That’s good. The internet should be a decentralised federation of information, free from control by any country or person. Censorship is as harmful as misinformation—people shouldn’t need the Dark Web to access all perspectives, true or not. No country should decide what I can or cannot access. Instead, efforts should focus on providing tools and education to help people evaluate information critically.</p>
