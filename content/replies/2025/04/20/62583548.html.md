<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> sometimes I wonder if doing long-term night shift is a little better, as you get into a routine. Instead of stopping and starting. Itâ€™s already bad enough going from 2 days afternoon shifts, to 1 day shift, day off, 3 day shifts, 2 afternoons etc etc randomly!</p>
