<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> yes of course. People are heightened in most jobs, as, if we are attending, usually it’s during someones worst moments. So someone that may appear to be compliant and friendly, suddenly can latch out and attack in fear that everything is over. So we are always careful of any indicators in body language, stance etc. But it’s still hard to tell as majority of the time, everything is fine, so it’s easy to get complacent.</p>
