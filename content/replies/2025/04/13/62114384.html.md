<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> yeah, itâ€™s pretty cool - no longer have to log into a website and type into an input box to make a post to the fedi. I can do it direct from the Obsidian app as Markdown. Then it uploads to the fedi and to my website (https://samuellison.com/2025/04/13/ok-i-got-obsidian-working.html) - but to see a reply I either have to go to my website and refresh the page or log into my fediverse account of course. And replying is still done through a website too heh. But still cool!</p>
