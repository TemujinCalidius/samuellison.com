<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/ai6yr@m.ai6yr.org" class="u-url mention">@ai6yr</a></span> hmmm I carry 10 x less than that on the daily as Iâ€™ve gone back to cash, FROM cashless. But 3k is excessive. $300 seems to be a good sweet spot to cover most needs and reduces the risk of being robbed of so much more I guess.</p>
