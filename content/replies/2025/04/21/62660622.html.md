<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> Yeah itâ€™s tough not being able to get good results for your clients. Itâ€™s a shame really, and I feel like a lot of areas of work in government and more so in mental health, is just tick and flick. A lot of covering your own back side, then the client is just left there with no outcome.</p>

<p>Well hopefully you will find work you love. But, you arenâ€™t going to find it if you havenâ€™t got that CV/Resume finished yet! Did you end up finishing that task? ðŸ˜‰</p>
