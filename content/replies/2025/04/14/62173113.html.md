<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/lilstevie@infosec.exchange" class="u-url mention">@lilstevie</a></span> I definitely did not like Season 6. It went backwards. I think Episode 1 is good in Season 7 and comes back to Season 1’s strange roots. But I haven’t gone on to watch the next ones just yet. Need to go see my shrink first.</p>
