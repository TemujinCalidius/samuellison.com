<p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> the pixelfed cross-posting still will not work for me, but with a different error now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could not connect to the Pixelfed instance photos.familylison.com. Make sure you have entered only the hostname.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No errors in the logs. Iâ€™ve tried different browsers too.</p>
