<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> it has pros and cons. Have to use it wisely. Because compartmentalising can lead you to just slowly filling up a bucket with traumatic jobs, stressful paperwork and policies and every other little thing. If not managed, you could get to a point of overfilling that bucket where youâ€™ve had enough and can no longer manage even the smallest things.
