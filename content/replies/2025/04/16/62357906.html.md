<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/GrapheneOS@grapheneos.social" class="u-url mention">@GrapheneOS</a></span> nah I love that. I block all unknown numbers, and block all numbers not in my contact list. My voicemail specifically says (in an AI voice I generated) that I do not answer calls from unknown numbers and if itâ€™s important and want a call back, to leave a voicemail - or sms - or email.</p>
<p>Anyone important enough is on my contacts and/or knows emergency numbers to reach me on.</p>
