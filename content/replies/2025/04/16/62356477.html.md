<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/codinghorror@infosec.exchange" class="u-url mention">@codinghorror</a></span> didn’t like Demon 79 - I did like Joan is Awful though, will agree there :)</p>
<p>I’ve only watched 4 episodes of Season 7 - but I have liked all 4 episodes thus far.</p>
