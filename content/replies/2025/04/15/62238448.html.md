<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> hmm, hard to answer that one. In the area I work, generally nights allow for catch up on some of our work. But, generally (especially when the full moon is out), we get more violence due to drinking, or mental health, or even burglaries at opportune times. I find the busiest times though are mornings just before people head off to work, and nights prior to people getting to bed. Partners inevitably arguing with each other, escalating to a point of losing control. Mostly for me it is domestic violence we deal with unfortunately.</p>
