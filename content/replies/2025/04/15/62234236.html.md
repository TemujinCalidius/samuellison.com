<p><a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/grubz">@grubz</a>  violence you are also inevitably hurting people with the same opinions as you and would stand with you at a protest, but you’ve gone and targeted someone based on a brand they chose to purchase prior to all this occurring in the first place. So then you lost that potential supporter to your cause due to the struggles, stress and pressure you have put onto their lives due to your stupidity and hatred.</p>
<p>You’re attacking your own people, who you need to stand with you, not against you.</p>
