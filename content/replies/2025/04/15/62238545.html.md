<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> I’m no medical expert, but reducing anti-depressants on your own, gradually and seeing how you cope mentally is a challenging process and quite courageous of you. As long as you monitor it and control your state. I’m anti big-pharma myself, so being able to come off something like that, and dig into your core issues on your own without reliance on a drug - that’s where real things happen. Could be good; could also be bad. Your journaling you’ve been doing though, will keep you guided and hopefully grounded.</p>
