<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> I’m pretty good with detaching and keeping work and life personalities completely compartmentalised at the moment. I just find it interesting that fully grown adults, don’t know how to adult and respect each other.</p>
<p>Accidents do happen, though mostly during peak hour or when the weather changes but drivers don’t change their manner of driving.</p>
<p>We do get crime, and domestic violence usually has crimes attached too. I just find those are the most common in my locality.</p>
