<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/unusnemo@friendica.rogueproject.org" class="u-url mention">@unusnemo</a></span> oh all good, my apologies. I should have read the full conversation and not just reply direct to yours post (it’s all I saw in my timeline!). I agree, most moderation is not used widely, or wisely. I’ve not used Friendica as yet either.</p>
<p>Even for mid sized servers, the weakness of decentralized servers is most are run by regular you and I’s who aren’t professional moderators and don’t run social media as a business. Hobby servers with limited funds.</p>
