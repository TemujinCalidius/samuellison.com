<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/unusnemo@friendica.rogueproject.org" class="u-url mention">@unusnemo</a></span> kids can moderate all they like on their instances, makes no difference to anyone. All moderation does, is local to that instance.</p>
<p>Larger instances however would benefit from a good moderation system, as itâ€™s also more about moderating your own userbase and content going in and out of your instance. Not moderating ends your instance unfederated from other servers. Also if your membership is open, you want to prevent illegal content, as you are responsible.</p>
