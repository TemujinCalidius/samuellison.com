<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/mangatake@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@mangatake</a></span> I know those feelings - but if that’s what’s holding you back to just get out there, it’ll keep on holding you back. You can still make it “good enough”, send it off to a few people, adjust, and adjust until you are happy (as you go) - like personal sites are never done ;)</p>
