<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/MakerTube@mastodon.social" class="u-url mention">@MakerTube</a></span> - has something happened to your instance? Your website is down and Iâ€™ve been spammed with videos uploaded to my own accounts on your service? <span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/thesporetrail@makertube.net" class="u-url mention">@thesporetrail</a></span>? I use 2FA and strong passwords. Has your server been breached?</p>
