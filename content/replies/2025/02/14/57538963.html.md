<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://micro.blog/drahardja@sfba.social" class="u-url mention">@drahardja</a></span> the beauty about the Fediverse though, is that you are never truly blocked. But I just wanted to add, blocking someone for replying respectfully (not trolling), to your public post, is quite weak, IMHO.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve eternally hosted your post on my own website to remind me that the world is full of sensitive people who really should not make social media posts, if they aren’t willing to have discussions.</p>
<p>I do love my Tesla though :)</p>
