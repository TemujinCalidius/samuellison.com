<p>Welcome to The Spore Trail! This privacy policy outlines how we handle personal information in relation to the use of my website, which is hosted on Micro.blog. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your data and how we manage content from other social media platforms through webmentions.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Micro.blog Data Collection Practices:</strong> Since my website is hosted on Micro.blog, I adhere to their data collection practices. Micro.blog collects information when you register on their site or participate in their community. This typically includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Your Name and Email Address:</strong> When registering with Micro.blog, you might provide your name and email address. However, visiting my site does not require registration or providing personal information to me directly.</li>
    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> When you post on Micro.blog, they record the IP address from which the post originated. This is not something I collect or have access to, but it's part of Micro.blog's practices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Webmentions:</strong> My site might display content from other social media platforms if I am mentioned through webmentions. Webmentions are a way for websites to notify each other when one site links to another, similar to how social media platforms interact. This means:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Content from Other Users:</strong> If someone mentions me or my site via a webmention, content from their social media post might appear on my site. This content is not collected by me but rather shared through the webmention protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Micro.blog Use:</strong> Micro.blog uses the information they collect for running their platform and providing services. I do not have access to or use this information beyond what is displayed on my site through their hosting.</li>
    <li><strong>Webmentions:</strong> Content from webmentions is used to enhance interaction and community engagement on my site, showing how others are discussing or linking to my content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>My site uses Font Awesome for icons, which involves the use of cookies from <a href="https://ka-f.fontawesome.com" target="_blank">ka-f.fontawesome.com</a> and <a href="https://kit.fontawesome.com" target="_blank">kit.fontawesome.com</a>. These cookies are set to enhance the user experience by providing icons without the need for local hosting, which could impact site performance. Here's how these cookies are used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> Font Awesome uses cookies to ensure that icons load correctly and efficiently. These cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the icons on my site.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Font Awesome might also use cookies for analytics to understand which icons are popular or to improve their service. However, I do not have access to or collect this data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that while these cookies are set by Font Awesome, my site itself does not use cookies for tracking or collecting user data beyond what is necessary for the icons to function. If you wish to opt-out of these cookies, you can do so by adjusting your browser settings or using a tool like a cookie consent manager, though this might affect the display of icons on my site.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Micro.blog:</strong> As the hosting service, Micro.blog might integrate third-party services for functionality like hosting, analytics, or user authentication. Any interaction with these services would be governed by Micro.blog's privacy policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>If your content appears on my site via webmentions and you wish for it to be removed, you have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Request for Removal:</strong> You can contact me directly to request the removal of your content from my site. Please use the contact form provided below or reach out via email at <a href="mailto:samuel@familylison.com">samuel@familylison.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>For any requests regarding the removal of content or any privacy-related inquiries, please contact me at:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:samuel@familylison.com">samuel@familylison.com</a></li>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on this page, with the updated effective date.</p>
