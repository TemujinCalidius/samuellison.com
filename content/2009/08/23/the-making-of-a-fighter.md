<p>A new Chapter in my life is being made as I write this blog post. And that is ‘<strong>The Making of a Fighter</strong>’.</p>  <p>Those of you who have been keeping up with my blog, know that I have been doing Muay Thai as a sport and as a way to keep myself fit. But I am taking it to the next level, now that the opportunity has been given. I wish to become a Fighter, and get myself on the ring over time with hard training.</p>  <p>I’ve been asking around, and a lot of fighters work full time on top of their training. So really, whether or not you can become a fighter has a lot to do with the right mentality and strength in your mind to motivate yourself to work your 10 hour days and then go straight off to training for a few more hours after that before finally getting home to relax. </p>  <p>I believe I have the mentality and the strength to push myself to train hard and make something of myself. Energy and explosive energy are very much in the mind; I’ve proven that to myself various times. Of course, the right foods also play a very large role in this. it is much like weight training. The three biggest ingredients in life to get where you want always remain: <strong>DIET, TRAINING, SLEEP</strong>. By diet I do not mean a ‘lose weight’ diet. I mean eating the right foods that focus on where you want to go. High carbs to gain weight (of course, high carbs being complex carbs with less chance of storing as ‘fat’), proteins to feed your muscles before and after training and so on.</p>  <p>So, I will start the heavy routine on Monday. Working from 5am till 3-4pm. Doing fight training from 5-6pm. Stopping to feed the body with more energy and doing weight training from 6-7pm. Doing the intermediate training and cardio from 7-8pm and finishing up with some floor work with Karl to do some Jujitsu training or sparring. Hopefully home and in bed by 10pm and ready for the next day of work and stuffing the body full of good foods and energy.</p>  <p>John Scida tells me he can make good fighters (and I’ve seen it). But, I doubt we can make good fighters who haven’t the mentality and strength to push themselves to the limit? You need the right person, the right stock. From my reading on Melbourne’s underworld, I’ve noticed that most if not all of the main figures involved, were fighters in their past; either Muay Thai, Kick Boxing, Boxing and so forth. Why? Is it because that these Men were strong minded? And why were they the way they were? St. Albans and Sunshine is considered a brewing location for fighters. Because they learn to fend for themselves on the street? But it’s also considered a brewing location for the criminals? And why is it that criminals are the ones with the strong mindset to train and become fighters?</p>  <p>Is there a balance between fight training and relaxing the mind and body?</p>  <p>And for great trainers like John Scida. Does it not become disappointing to lose potentially great fighters who’ve trained so hard and well only to be lost to the law system or to be found ten feet under?</p>  <p>I wish to become 1 out of 200 students. I will become 1 out of 200 students. I will work, I will train, I will relax and rest. And I will stay on my side of the fence. That of a life of honour, respect, loyalty. </p>  <p>The new Chapter begins.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
