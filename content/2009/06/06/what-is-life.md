<p>Many people will ask the question – What is life?</p>  <p>There is no answer to this question, as no one can tell you what life is or how to live it. Except ideals, such as this which I was thinking of this morning as I was looking out at the beautiful sunrise.</p>  <p>Life is God   <br>Life is the Universe    <br>Life is the Sun, the Moon, the Stars    <br>Life is Rain, Sorrow, Cold, Warmth, Happiness    <br>Life is Stress Free    <br>You are Life    <br>You are in control of Life    <br>Life is what you make it.</p>  <p>Be happy and make of life what you wish!</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Good day!</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
