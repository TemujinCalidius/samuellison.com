<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samlison/3619423762/"><img title="tattoo" height="279" alt="tattoo" src="https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/82891a032a.jpg" width="185" align="right" border="0"></a>My tattoo design is ready to go. I’ve picked it up and have booked in to get it done on the 17th of July for the outlining and then on the 31st of July for the shading and what not. </p>  <p>I wonder how much it’ll hurt?</p>  <p>I’ve decided to put my name in the handle scroll and 8 family names from my brother, sister, parents and  grand parents down the blade of the sword which will symbolise my blood and inner power through to my hands/wrists. </p>  <p>It’ll be a 3/4 sleeve design all the way down my right arm. Once this is done I’m getting my family crest designed in tattoo form for my left arm in a shield, and possibly after that a large design on my back which is still sitting in my mind (warrior mounted on a large eagle swooping down with talons open to capture a naked woman in the open fields of grass).</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
