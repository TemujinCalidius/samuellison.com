I am getting more left forearm designed with the words in Japanese characters representing ‘Bushido’ or ‘Way of the Warrior’. I may or may not get that done by Christmas, time will tell. All I know is that with this darn heat wave it’s more painful than getting tattooed during winter where you can even cover up.</p>  <p>I’ve got so much more to post about my life but haven’t the time to do so right now. See what I can do tomorrow :P</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
