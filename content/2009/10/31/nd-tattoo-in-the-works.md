Just need to go back again in a few weeks to finish up the shading and the likes. </p>  <p>Apologies for not posting to my blog for so long, but I have been rather busy with work as well as life in general.</p>  <p>Just for the update, I’ve been continuing my Muay Thai training, and added on weight training again. I can’t get over exercise anymore, it is so much fun; and you feel good about yourself, more confident.</p>  <p>Let me know what you all think (so far)!</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
