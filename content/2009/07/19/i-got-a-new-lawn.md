Within 15 minutes I arrive and we’re off to bargain on a good laptop. </p>  <p>I spent 4 hours with them setting everything up, the toughest part being the router due to having to get the internet access passwords back and such and making sure it’s well secured from outside users trying to access the wireless options. They have 3 laptops and a PC accessing the router.</p>  <p>8am the next morning I am awakened by a phone call asking if I am home. A bran new lawn mower is awaiting me at my door within the next half hour as a thank you gift for my service to the family. </p>  <p>I guess that will stop me spending money on Jim’s Mowing (check my old posts!) every few weeks to get my lawn done. Because I was so lazy to bother going to borrow one all the time; or buy one :P I guess all I need now is a whipper snipper! Any wish-list givers?</p>  <p>You buy me one I’ll thank you on my blog ;)</p>  <p>But really, what I am trying to say is that there are not many people like this left in the world. Who are men of their word and respect. I know I am a man of this type, who if I have respect for someone because they too respect me, I would jump at any given moment to give them a helping hand and be there when needed.</p>  <p>Are you that type of man? </p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
