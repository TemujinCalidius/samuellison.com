Because I don’t! I work 50 hour weeks and by the time I get home or the weekend comes around I’m just too buggered. All I want to do is relax and enjoy the weekend while I can; making the most of it. Much like I am doing now – sitting here relaxing on a Friday afternoon as a very nice bloke from Jim’s Mowing who’s still on business hours works on my front and back yard.</p>  <p>As you can see from the photo I took on the right, it look(ed) quite a mess. Since splitting up with my Ex-Girlfriend and her having still lived here for a while I refused to do all the dirty work; which I think is fair?</p>  <p>Ok, so if I did it in the first place, the grass wouldn’t have gotten this bad and I wouldn’t of had to call in Jim’s Mowing to do the work. But these guys do a good job, and they are good on the price.</p>  <p>My front lawn and back lawn cost a total of $70, including weeding. And if I use them on an ongoing basis it’ll cost $50. I know, I’m lazy and should buy a lawn mower. But for shared accommodation? I think it’s a good set up :)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/samlison/3575496574/"><img title="IMG00021" height="245" alt="IMG00021" src="https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/c4d006de93.jpg" width="287" align="left" border="0"></a></p>  <p>Wouldn’t you agree? Now all that’s left to do is get my lazy but up and fix those bricks surrounding the trees :D</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="" alt=""></div>
