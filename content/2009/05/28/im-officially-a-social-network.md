It seems that ever since using my sisters laptop (mind you I can’t wait to get my new one of my own so I can post a whole lot more funner subjects including videos) I’ve become more hooked onto social networking sites.</p>  <p>I’m now connected to Twitter, FaceBook, Blogger (this blog), Windows Live Spaces, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Gmail, Google Reader, Calender and more!</p>  <p>I’m planning on having my main website <a href="http://www.samuellison.com">www.samuellison.com</a> designed by professionals linking to all of these services directly to me. And while I’m getting that done I’m thinking about getting a really nifty personal business card (what else do you call them even if they are not for business use? Contact Card? Social Card?) with personal graphics, logo, website address and mobile phone.     <br>I was thinking my site to be directed to me in online form; having a cartoon character created with me wearing what I do in my real workplace (all whites) but with a laptop and all these techie goodies; making him somewhat cool yet… meaty :P </p>  <p>I’ll get a quote on web design and graphics design. It’ll be one page only with perhaps a contact form to my gmail account or something. We’ll see what I can get done!</p>  <div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-24829348645671267?l=samlison.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
