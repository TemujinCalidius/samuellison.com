<p>Finally got my <a href="https://social.familylison.com/tags/PixelFed" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>PixelFed</span></a>  instance working and have been uploading some of my photos to it that I took recently. Since I won&#39;t be using <a href="https://social.familylison.com/tags/Instagram" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Instagram</span></a>  anymore.</p><p>You may seen a bunch of photos show up on your feed, enjoy :)</p>
