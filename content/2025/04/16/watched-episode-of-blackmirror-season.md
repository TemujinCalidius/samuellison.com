Watched Episode 5 of #BlackMirror Season 7. Sad really, actually got a tear out of me. The things we humans do in life and focus on selfish thoughts and don't blink an eye at or think about what the other persons perspective may be, their emotions and own life experience.

5/6 of the Episodes I have enjoyed greatly. For anyone to think they are not original... not sure what their perspective is on that. Wouldn't mind knowing!
