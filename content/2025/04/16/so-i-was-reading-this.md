So I was reading [this](https://axxuy.xyz/blog/posts/2025/attention/) today about Blogging for attention:
>I want people to read what I write here. I want (hope) to be a familiar face in feed readers. I want to be linked to. The internet is a network and I want to be part of it. 

I think every blogger goes through this. Webmentions are handy, but now there are ActivityPub integrations that work well and allow your thoughts to be read by followers on the #fediverse directly. #IndieMicroblogging is [real](https://book.micro.blog/).
