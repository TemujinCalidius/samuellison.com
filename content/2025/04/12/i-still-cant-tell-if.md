I still can't tell if this account is being seen by you guys out there since I moved over from [@samuel@social.familylison.com](https://micro.blog/samuel@social.familylison.com) - anyone willing to post a comment/reply so I can confirm it's getting out to you. I am not posting from my Mastodon Instance but from micro.blog.
