My mother told me that my daughter is having difficulty with her homework and tutoring as she has an addiction to the iPad and in particular #Roblox.
 
After some discussion, I have put some restrictions on the XBOX to prevent both the girls from playing anything on it from 3pm to 6pm after school if I am not at home, as it seems that when both my wife and I are at work, the kids will rush to get to Grandmas' iPAD and run upstairs to the XBOX to play Roblox together.
