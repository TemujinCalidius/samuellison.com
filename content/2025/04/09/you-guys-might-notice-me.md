You guys might notice me replying with a different fediverse account [@samuel@samuellison.com](https://micro.blog/samuel@samuellison.com) - I am slowly using that account to reply from using Micro.Blog as it syndicates better with my website at www.samuellison.com and shows replies on my own #indieweb website. My Mastodon Instance will probably become where I #POSSE to for backups, or I may end up not requiring it down the track at all.
