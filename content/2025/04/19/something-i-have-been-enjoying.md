Something I have been enjoying about the #Fediverse is the ability to follow domains instead of just social accounts. Some creators have both the domain with news articles and a dedicated social network account on things like #Mastodon. But these tend to sometimes get too much, like #GrapheneOS lately. I can keep updated with actual product news by following their domain, and not get all the other stuff that is not relevant to me.
