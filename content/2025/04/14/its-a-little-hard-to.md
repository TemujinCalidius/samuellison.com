It's a little hard to plan for the coming week, due to doing #NightShift at work. Makes it difficult to gather the energy to actually **do** things productively. I know there's a few friend and family dinners planned which I will tick boxes off there and have some social fun. This is actually one of the reasons I dislike working the #graveyard shift. Throws life way out of wack!
