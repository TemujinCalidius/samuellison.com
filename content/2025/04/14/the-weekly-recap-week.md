I thought I would try something new this week with my weekly journal entries where I would normally just quickly look through the last 7 days and note down to myself what I have done well or not. 

Basically, why don't I do a recap that goes through what I accomplished for the week based on a lot of the daily notes I made and go into more detail, since larger long-form content allows for more characters and space to just let it all out and stretch?

## Onto the Recap!

Although I don't feel I ticked off enough of my *daily tasks* such as regular skipping/jump-roping, reading, meditating and what not, I feel like I did have a busy week and a lot of debriefing to do with myself. There's a lot to unpack here and more that I will need to write about, now that I come to think of it.

## Some things I did

### Phillip Island
Just at the end of last week, the family and I took off to #PhillipIsland and stayed by a beach house. In one of my notes, I state that I should write more of an article about it, yet, I have not yet done so. I need to add this to my list of things to do!

I did at least make a video of it for the family to see, but nothing public about it to discuss where we went, what it was like out there, what did we see?

Stay-tuned, as I may update this post later when I make the journal entry about our trip as a whole.

### An unsuspected death 
Sometimes life throws you curve-balls, and unfortunately we recently had one of those. 

My eldest daughter has been taking #guitar lessons for a while and had this really great elderly teacher who seemed so happy, so healthy. Until one day, he would try to speak, yet no words come out.

The teacher ended up in hospital for a few days. We all assumed something like #Apraxia or something similar that affected the brain and his ability to form words.

In actuality, it was a #melanoma in the chest, a #cancer, that had already taken over and it was too late. The teacher was given a week to live from that diagnosis. 

Unfortunately I did not get to take my daughter to visit the teacher to say her goodbyes, as it was already too late and coma had set in and it would not have been appropriate. 

### New UPS
I purchased a new #UPS for our #NAS due to power surges happening during the week as well. This should greatly reduce the risk of permanent damage due to surges on the NAS, modem and switches. I've also set the NAS up to auto shut down when power goes out and the NAS uses battery backup.

### Vibe Coding - The new Buzz Word out there.
I did a little bit of #VibeCoding in #OpenSimulator and worked a little more on #SurvivorCore. Just added some "consumable" scripts to increase or decrease any survival stats in the game.

### Kids Homework
I found out that my youngest daughter had not been doing her homework properly as she's been more focused on wanting to play #Roblox on grandma's iPad upstairs while her older sister would play on the XBOX.  

I went and put some restrictions on the internet to try prevent them playing while I am at work straight after school, and try to get them to focus on doing their chores and homework prior to any games.

Because the kids enjoy their iPads as much as I enjoy my #Linux computing - I've encouraged them to take photos of their homework and tutoring and send to my mother who does their tutoring, to show the completed work and get daily feedback via video calls and what not. 

### A New Job, New Opportunities
I caught up with an old friend prior to him having to fly to #Canberra for his new job. Was great to catch up.

He'll be gone for 12 to 15 weeks for the training before being brought back here to #Melbourne to do the role he applied for and was a successful applicant for.

It's great when you see friends achieve a goal they had set and get into a dream job they had been trying at for years.

There is always a light at the end of the tunnel, somewhere out there. You just gotta find it.

### Hiking - Werribee Gorge
I went for a #hike to #WerribeeGorge with the girls and this was a lot of fun. I should make a #CaptainsLog post about this as well. Stay tuned for that one as I will make another journal entry there and update this article to point to it to prove it!

I'm very proud of my kids for accomplishing this one as it was challenging enough for such youngins.

### Obsidian, a new tool
I also did a lot of playing around on #Obsidian to improve on my #journal workflow. I used it for this article, and am using it now for all my #microblog entries and notes. 

It allows me to organise all my thoughts in a map, to publish straight to my website and to the #fediverse as well.

I've found I've been more productive using this tool - though, maybe that's just a feeling? Is writing your thoughts and journal considered a form of procrastination in and of itself? We will see when I look back in a few months, or years, won't we?

I get to keep short notes within a larger daily entry. I can look back at the whole week and then make a post like this one to reflect on the whole week - see where I can improve on and so on...

I can also use it as a link aggregator in my short micro entries. Posting a link of a website I looked at and found interesting, and briefly talk about the subject matter. If I find I am talking about a certain #hashtag over and over, I can see an obvious trend in my current interests and choose to post in more detail about it.

## On to Next Week
Anyway, I have more things to do. This was my first weekly recap. I plan to do more - but alas, there's only so much time in a day!
