I wrote a whole [weekly recap](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/21/the-weekly-recap-week.html) for last week if you would like to read. Other than that, time to get back into the daily routines and back to normal life for a while. 

In the recap, I talk about all of last week, including my line of work, #NightShift's, the new #BlackMirror season, #AISlop and hallucinations and John Carpenter's 1988 movie, They Live!
