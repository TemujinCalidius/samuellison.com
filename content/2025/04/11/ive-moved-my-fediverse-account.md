I've moved my fediverse account to [@samuel@samuellison.com](https://micro.blog/slison) as it makes more sense to me. You should automatically be following me if I did it right!

Please let me know if you see me :)

All my posts are now synced with [samuellison.com](https://samuellison.com) and if you go to [samuellison.com/categories/thoughts/](https://samuellison.com/categories/thoughts/) all my #microblog posts are there.

And yes, I have RSS.
