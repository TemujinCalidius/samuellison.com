I've been using #AI a lot to assist with problems and have come across a problem I am seeing pop up with all #LLM's lately.

I feel that they are getting dumber and more susceptible to #hallucinations. I've been put into hours worth of rabbit holes for a potential solution to a problem only to argu with the LLM about the information it is providing being misinformation and completely made up. 

AI is learning from AI generated slop all over the internet and it is having an effect.
