I couldn't resist #BlackMirror also watched Episode 4 of Season 7. Interesting to see the new technologies my form of work might get access to in the future. But also interesting the topics touched, #LSD, the language of sounds and light. The world outside of this physical realm we see with our two physical eyes. Isn't that why a lot of coders in silicon valley are into the #microdosing these days? The world of #fungi is an interesting one. Streaming direct from the #muse.
