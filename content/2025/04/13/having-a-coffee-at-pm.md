Having a coffee at 8:30 PM and getting ready for the first night of #NightShift this week. It's rare I do night shifts, but it has to be done. The first night is always the hardest, breaking your daily routine and sleep cycle. I should have tried to stay up the night prior by watching movies, reading the #fediverse or playing some type of game to start getting into this cycle. Oh well!
