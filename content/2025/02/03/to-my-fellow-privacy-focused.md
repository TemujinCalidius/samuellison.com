To my fellow #privacy focused individuals. I've been using a #Fitbit for some time, and as you are aware, #Google purchased the brand a while ago now, and I have been #De-Googling my life.

What solutions have you found for #fitnesstracking? I'd be interested to know about any #OpenSource tracking options that work well with GPS and hiking apps such as #Alltrails, or other alternatives.

I'm new to this area of privacy! Beyond just taking the tracker off completely and going without.
