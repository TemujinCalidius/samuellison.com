Now that I am on #Linux, just playing around with my old #Nikon D7000 and editing in #DarkTable. I know, the sharpness isn't perfect, it's a loan camera and I don't have the lenses I want. I will get myself a #Sony #A6700 soon and some proper lenses though!

Come to think of it, I should have tried Focus Stacking. Although it would all have to be manual with this old thing :D
