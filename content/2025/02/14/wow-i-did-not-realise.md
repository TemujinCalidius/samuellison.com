Wow, I did not realise that #tracking was that complex. Data brokers know your every move! Be careful how many apps, and what apps, you allow on your phone.

I am glad I made the move to #GrapheneOS, which started my progress of removing as many apps as possible from my phone. Dumb it down! THen work on the PC!
