This post is basically a re-post of some of my favourite photos so that you are able to find them.

When I transitioned my website from using Wordpress to Micro.blog I lost access to my old posts and the media I had uploaded to that server.

Luckily, I only had 3 articles so far, as I was still finishing my web design and waiting on some new gear to go out and photograph with.

Below are my favourite photos that were all taken using a **Nikon D7000** while out hiking in various locations of Victoria.

  <figcaption>Captured these delicate orchids in my backyard using my old Nikon camera. Practicing light and shadows, I'm finding beauty in the small details of nature right at home. ðŸ“¸ Excited to keep learning and improving!</figcaption>

I will make all of these photos available on my [Patron](https://https://www.patreon.com/thesporetrail) page for FREE. You can become a member for free and download all of these in their original format.

They may not currently be in 16:9 ratio and optimized for Social Media content, but these are my first attempts at photography and will always hold a #nostalgic place to me.

I am sure that you will enjoy these. Please let me know in the comments what you think.
