Hiking has become a cherished activity for me, and it’s even more special when shared with loved ones. Two days ago, I embarked on a hike with my mother through the **Whipstick Loop Walk**, located in **Blackwood, Victoria**, within the **Wombat State Forest**. This 5.8 km loop trail, which takes about two hours to complete, is a relatively easy and scenic walk, perfect for someone like my mother, who is rediscovering hiking after decades. 

The trail is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from ferny rainforests near the river to classic Australian bushland with towering eucalypts. It’s a sensory delight, with the crunch of debris underfoot, the fresh smells of eucalyptus and ferns, and the melodic calls of native birds.

### Preparing for the Day

We set out on **Friday, 14th February 2024**, a pleasant summer day with a temperature of 23°C. I picked up my mother at 8:00 am, and we arrived at the trailhead by 9:00 am. The previous day’s light rain had left the trail floor scattered with leaves and twigs, adding to the charm of the walk. 

Given my mother’s age (65+) and her recent return to hiking, I carefully chose this trail for its gentle inclines and stable footing. It’s a great option for beginner hikers or those easing back into the activity. You can find more details about the trail on [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/whipstick-loop-walk).

### Wildlife Encounters

About halfway through the walk, we were thrilled to spot a [**koala**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala) perched on a young gum tree. It was munching on leaves and scratching itself—a behaviour I later learned is a way for koalas to spread their scent. Here’s the photo I captured:

Later, as we neared the three-quarter mark of the trail, we were treated to another magical moment. Four [**southern boobook owls**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_boobook) flew by, and one landed on a branch right in front of us. I managed to snap a photo of it as it turned its head in a near 270-degree spin. These owls are Australia’s smallest and most common owl species. Here’s the image:

### The Trail’s Beauty

One of the things I love most about the Whipstick Loop Walk is its variety. The trail transitions from lush rainforest-like areas near the river to classic Australian bushland as you gain elevation. The eucalypts here bear the marks of bushfires and strong winds, creating a dramatic and rugged landscape. 

Although it’s summer and not the ideal season for fungi, I couldn’t help but reminisce about my previous visits during autumn. The decomposing logs and damp conditions then bring out stunning mushrooms, perfect for photography. On this trip, I didn’t bring my professional camera, but I did snap some of my favourite fungi photos on past visits. Here’s one of a cluster of red mushrooms I captured with my trusty [**Nikon D7000**](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond7000), a 14-year-old camera that still delivers stunning results:

### Reflections

The hike was a wonderful experience, not just for the natural beauty but for the time spent with my mother. She worked up a sweat by the end, but the cool forest temperatures (ranging from 14°C to 19°C) kept the exertion manageable. It’s heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and I’m grateful for these moments we share. 

I plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.
