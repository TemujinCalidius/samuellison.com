So with these new law changes coming eventually to social media, including the need to verify ourselves with ID to prove our age - how does that look for #Mastodon and other #Fediverse social media? In particular the larger instances that have responsibility to its user base under their own countries laws?

I don't think this would affect small private servers in any way, but I'm interested to know more...
