<p>While trying to get fit, I&#39;ve been adding 30 minutes of jump rope / skipping to my daily routine and I put on hardstyle trance music. The last track however, happened to be 240bpm, that&#39;s 4 beats per second. Meaning, I was jumping and hitting the floor 4 times per second to this particular track.</p><p>I&#39;m buggered.</p>
