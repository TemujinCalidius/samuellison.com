From my reading about social media platforms growing exponentially, there comes a point where growing a #moderation team is essential. This problem is less common with the #Fediverse with self-hosted small instances. But what about the larger instances? Have any #devs thought about implementing features such as is available in #Discourse. A #trust based moderation system as a community grows? Is that even a feasible thing to do?
