My #hiking video is in the process of transcoding on #MakerTube, which is a #PeerTube instance I use for hosting my video content. 

From quick watching currently during the transcoding process, I hear no audio. I hope that this is just during transcoding, as it's a long upload and transcoding process just to have a video with no audio.
