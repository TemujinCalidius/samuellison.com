Recently, I have had a fascination with wanting to try out hiking in the darkness of the night.

Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of reading about night hiking and what the benefits might be, including being able to stay cooler in the summer heat, experiencing the fascinating sounds of the nocturnal wildlife, and seeing the night sky up above.
