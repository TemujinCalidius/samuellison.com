Reading [@manton.org](http://manton.org)'s book on #IndieMicroBlogging fascinated me, and during my reading, I bumped into a blog that does #microcasting type of setup. I am now doing it too with my two children. A daily, 3 to 5 minute #PodCast for our own memories. And my daughter did the artwork!




<img src="uploads/2025/podcast.png" width="600" height="391" alt="A screenshot of a podcast page titled &quot;The Family Pod&quot; with the username &quot;@samuel.&quot; The header features hand-drawn artwork by a child, depicting a sunset with vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues behind two dark mountains. The podcast description reads: &quot;This podcast is a family podcast between dad and his two daughters, Ariyah and Zoey. Every day (or thereabouts), the objective is to record a quick 3 to 5-minute podcast, talking about the day, our accomplishments, and our plans for the next day. And, of course, to have a laugh!&quot; The category is &quot;Kids & Family,&quot; and the location is Melbourne, Australia. Stats show 0 seasons, 1 episode, and the first episode published on March 15, 2025. A &quot;Follow&quot; button and an RSS podcast feed link are visible. The page is powered by Castopod.">
