I feel #Liberated! I have finally managed to delete as many apps as possible from my phone (fully #degoogled too). I now use Airplane mode with wifi calling exclusively at home, and only turn on my 4G/5G mobile connection at locations when and if I need it (no tracking from providers). 

Essentially feels like I have de-phoned myself but still have one in my pocket for emergency calls should I need it.
Should the family need me urgently? They know my work landline. We survived pre 90's.
