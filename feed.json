That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky.</p>\n<p>Initially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-experience\">The Experience</h2>\n<p>So there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at <a href=\"https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park\">Werribee Gorge</a>, about to do the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track\">Long and Short Circuit Track combined</a>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>My torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark.</p>\n<p>While I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.</p>\n<p>The torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you&rsquo;d like to check out the torch, it&rsquo;s a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on <a href=\"https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam.</p>\n<p>I also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet!<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there&rsquo;s plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strange-sounds\">Strange Sounds</h3>\n<p>While commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that&rsquo;s how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.</p>\n<p>I was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don&rsquo;t know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"and-then-came-the-next-challenge\">And then came the next challenge.</h3>\n<p>You see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below.</p>\n<p>Putting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serene-views--wildlife\">Serene Views &amp; Wildlife</h3>\n<p>On the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.</p>\n<p>As the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a <a href=\"https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system\">filtration system</a>, of course), and you&rsquo;re actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it&rsquo;s a much sought after resource!</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It&rsquo;s got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn&rsquo;t too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!</p>\n<p>We finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Would I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?</p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let&rsquo;s see if we can tackle the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge\">Lerderderg Gorge</a> and I will let you all know how that goes!</p>\n<p>And then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.</p>\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below.\nWhat&rsquo;s your experience hiking in the darkness?

That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky. \n\nInitially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.\n\n## The Experience\n\nSo there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at [Werribee Gorge](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park), about to do the [Long and Short Circuit Track combined](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track).\n\nLuckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/shadowhawk-torch.jpg\" alt=\"A black flashlight with a strap is resting on a dark textured surface.\" title=\"Shadowhawk Torch\">\n\t<figcaption>A good and powerful torch is always recommended.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMy torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark. \n\nWhile I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.\n\nThe torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you'd like to check out the torch, it's a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on [Amazon](https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ). \n\nI'm not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam. \n\nI also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet![^3]\n\nAnother thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there's plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.\n\n### Strange Sounds\n\nWhile commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that's how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.\n\nI was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don't know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless. \n\n### And then came the next challenge.\n\nYou see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively. \n\nI'll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below. \n\nPutting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.\n\n### Serene Views & Wildlife\n\nOn the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.\n\nAs the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.\n\n<center><iframe title=\"Wallaby\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/72efb40c-ab67-41e3-9520-a5ad05548473\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe></center>\n\nOne of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a [filtration system](https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system), of course), and you're actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it's a much sought after resource!\n\nThere's also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It's got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/9609872753-b73286a802-b.jpg\" alt=\"A rocky cliffside with a rope trail runs alongside a calm river with dry trees and greenery in the background.\" title=\"Werribee Gorge Cable Run\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo Source: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/\">cafuego</a> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/9609872753\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/9609872753</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn't too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!\n\nWe finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWould I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?\n\nYes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let's see if we can tackle the [Lerderderg Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge) and I will let you all know how that goes!\n\nAnd then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.\n\nI hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below. \nWhat's your experience hiking in the darkness? Have you done it before? Would you do it again? If you haven't done it before, would you consider giving it a go?\n\n---\nFootnotes:\n[^1]: https://unlockoutdoors.com/benefits-of-night-hiking/\n[^2]: https://flyfreshflight.com/is-hiking-at-night-dangerous/\n[^3]: https://budgetlightforum.com/t/lithium-ion-battery-safety-101/38554\n\n",

The service supports mapping your personal domain to your [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") account, ensuring you maintain control over your digital identity.\n\n- **POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere):** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") facilitates posting from your own site and syndicating to various platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/ \"Mastodon\"), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app \"BlueSky\"), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com \"LinkedIn\"), and others, automatically, thereby keeping your content under your control while still reaching broader audiences.\n\n- **Webmentions, Micropub, and IndieAuth:** These [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\") standards are supported, allowing for rich interactions across the web, where comments or likes from one site can be reflected on another.\n\n- **ActivityPub:** Part of the Fediverse, [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") uses [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/ \"ActivityPub\") for federation, allowing your posts to interact with users on other compatible platforms.\n\n## **Subscription Model:**\n\n- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") operates on a **freemium model**. The basic plan starts at just **$1 per month**, which includes:\n  - Your own blog with unlimited posts\n  - Your own domain name\n  - Podcast hosting\n\nMore advanced features like automatic cross-posting, video hosting, and enhanced cross-posting capabilities are available in higher tiers.\n\n## **Freedom and Flexibility:**\n\n- **Domain Use:** Users are not locked into [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\"). You can use your own domain, ensuring that if you decide to leave, your content and URL identity remain with you.\n\n- **Backup Options:** \n  - **Automatic GitHub Backup:** Your blog can be backed up to a GitHub repository automatically, providing a secure, version-controlled backup of all your posts.\n  - **Internet Archive:** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") also offers periodic backups to the Internet Archive for long-term digital preservation.\n\n- **Export Formats:**\n  - **Hugo Format:** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ \"Hugo\") as its static site generator, which means all content can be exported in this format. This includes your posts in Markdown, theme files, and configuration, allowing for a seamless transition if you decide to self-host or move to another platform.\n  - Additionally, exports can be done in JSON, Markdown, and other blog archive formats, ensuring your data is never trapped.\n\n## **Why Hugo Format?**\n\nI recommend sticking with the Hugo format for several reasons:\n\n  - **Portability:** Hugo is well-regarded in the static site generation community, making it easy to find hosting or move to another service.\n  - **Maintainability:** With all posts in Markdown, editing or updating content post-export is straightforward.\n  - **Theme Customization:** The theme files allow you to maintain the look and feel of your blog even if you switch platforms.\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") stands out as a service that not only promotes but practically implements [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\") principles, offering a platform where blogging feels intimate yet expansive. Its commitment to user freedom, with easy data portability and the encouragement of personal domain use, makes it an excellent choice for those who value their digital independence. Whether you're a seasoned blogger or just starting, [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") offers a way to engage with the web that feels authentic and owned by you.\n\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@samuel@social.familylison.com\">\n",

Need to make sure to eat the right foods that can provide energy throughout the day, not just simple sugars that give you an hour boost, then all of a sudden, nothing.</p>  <p>I done some major core workouts 2 nights ago with my friend Dean. Over 120 push-ups &amp; 120 sit-ups.</p>  <p>Now I am sitting at home a little bored &amp; wondering what to do whilst waiting on some washing to complete. It’s a little too hot &amp; stuffy to clean the bathroom.</p>  <p>Tonight at 5pm I will be doing some light sparring – that will be fun. And tomorrow, more training and light sparring with Dean.</p>  <p>On other details, I am booking a night out at a vineyard in the Macedon Mountains for Dao &amp; I which should be both relaxing &amp; fun. We have never had the opportunity to have time completely alone with each other since we met more than a year ago now.    <br>We will be out in the country, enjoying the fresh air, a 3 course dinner &amp; breakfast in the morning.</p>  <p>Also I look forward to our time together in Vietnam. Instead of just being with Dao’s family, we will also be spending some time alone at a tourist resort by the finely sanded beach. This will be a whole lot of fun &amp; romantic.</p>  <p>Anyway, I need to look carefully into setting myself up a diet, which will enable me to store plenty of energy to burn throughout the day. Perhaps even gain me another 5kg or so.   <br>I wouldn’t mind hitting 75kg for my height and build.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "Week 1 – Not as Planned",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My first week of intense training did not go to plan for myself. Point is, I should have known to do more stretching before and after training. I did none - literally. </p>  <p>Now, the thing with this is. When you begin to push your muscles and work on ones that you’ve never really pushed before, if you don’t do stretching, you will feel the ache for days on end after each time your exercise.   <br>So, instead of getting a good full week of training, I got almost 2 days. I couldn’t finish my run on the treadmill as I had planned because of my calves and my right ankle. The ankle has been bad for a couple of weeks since beginning on the jump rope, but I bought some ankle guards to help with that. But on my first day of harder training I went for 3 by 3 minute rounds of skipping with 30 second breaks, on top of treadmill, weights, sparring and cardio; totalling 3 hours in the night. My muscles needed stretching, which I did not do. This put me off training for the rest of the week; argh!</p>  <p>I have 2 weeks off work now; holiday pay. So I’m happy about that. I can focus my mind, relax and concentrate on training properly. It’ll also give me time to relax my mind. Instead of work, train, work, train. I can produce a schedule to ease the mind. I found that with harder training and constantly thinking about fighting, you begin to lose the balance in your mind… something they call Yin Yang?  I felt a build up of testosterone for a while and more eager to get into a fight; more confident, but also to a point I felt I could be more cocky towards peoples attitude. This is something that is a big no for me, and requires that I focus, give myself time to sit down, close my eyes and bring my mind back to Earth. This was not during my first week; this had been building up over my previous 5 months.</p>  <p>Let’s hope next week will prove to be more of a success!</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "The Making of a Fighter",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A new Chapter in my life is being made as I write this blog post. And that is ‘<strong>The Making of a Fighter</strong>’.</p>  <p>Those of you who have been keeping up with my blog, know that I have been doing Muay Thai as a sport and as a way to keep myself fit. But I am taking it to the next level, now that the opportunity has been given. I wish to become a Fighter, and get myself on the ring over time with hard training.</p>  <p>I’ve been asking around, and a lot of fighters work full time on top of their training. So really, whether or not you can become a fighter has a lot to do with the right mentality and strength in your mind to motivate yourself to work your 10 hour days and then go straight off to training for a few more hours after that before finally getting home to relax. </p>  <p>I believe I have the mentality and the strength to push myself to train hard and make something of myself. Energy and explosive energy are very much in the mind; I’ve proven that to myself various times. Of course, the right foods also play a very large role in this. it is much like weight training. The three biggest ingredients in life to get where you want always remain: <strong>DIET, TRAINING, SLEEP</strong>. By diet I do not mean a ‘lose weight’ diet. I mean eating the right foods that focus on where you want to go. High carbs to gain weight (of course, high carbs being complex carbs with less chance of storing as ‘fat’), proteins to feed your muscles before and after training and so on.</p>  <p>So, I will start the heavy routine on Monday. Working from 5am till 3-4pm. Doing fight training from 5-6pm. Stopping to feed the body with more energy and doing weight training from 6-7pm. Doing the intermediate training and cardio from 7-8pm and finishing up with some floor work with Karl to do some Jujitsu training or sparring. Hopefully home and in bed by 10pm and ready for the next day of work and stuffing the body full of good foods and energy.</p>  <p>John Scida tells me he can make good fighters (and I’ve seen it). But, I doubt we can make good fighters who haven’t the mentality and strength to push themselves to the limit? You need the right person, the right stock. From my reading on Melbourne’s underworld, I’ve noticed that most if not all of the main figures involved, were fighters in their past; either Muay Thai, Kick Boxing, Boxing and so forth. Why? Is it because that these Men were strong minded? And why were they the way they were? St. Albans and Sunshine is considered a brewing location for fighters. Because they learn to fend for themselves on the street? But it’s also considered a brewing location for the criminals? And why is it that criminals are the ones with the strong mindset to train and become fighters?</p>  <p>Is there a balance between fight training and relaxing the mind and body?</p>  <p>And for great trainers like John Scida. Does it not become disappointing to lose potentially great fighters who’ve trained so hard and well only to be lost to the law system or to be found ten feet under?</p>  <p>I wish to become 1 out of 200 students. I will become 1 out of 200 students. I will work, I will train, I will relax and rest. And I will stay on my side of the fence. That of a life of honour, respect, loyalty. </p>  <p>The new Chapter begins.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Within 15 minutes I arrive and we’re off to bargain on a good laptop. </p>  <p>I spent 4 hours with them setting everything up, the toughest part being the router due to having to get the internet access passwords back and such and making sure it’s well secured from outside users trying to access the wireless options. They have 3 laptops and a PC accessing the router.</p>  <p>8am the next morning I am awakened by a phone call asking if I am home. A bran new lawn mower is awaiting me at my door within the next half hour as a thank you gift for my service to the family. </p>  <p>I guess that will stop me spending money on Jim’s Mowing (check my old posts!) every few weeks to get my lawn done. Because I was so lazy to bother going to borrow one all the time; or buy one :P I guess all I need now is a whipper snipper! Any wish-list givers?</p>  <p>You buy me one I’ll thank you on my blog ;)</p>  <p>But really, what I am trying to say is that there are not many people like this left in the world. Who are men of their word and respect. I know I am a man of this type, who if I have respect for someone because they too respect me, I would jump at any given moment to give them a helping hand and be there when needed.</p>  <p>Are you that type of man? </p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

By the looks of the thing, it was entering me about 2mm at a time, in and out, really fast. Just imagine the tip of a needle just sitting on your skin and dragging it along your arm slowly and that’s probably as close as you will get to the feeling. I will say that the pain is <em>sudden on</em>  as much as it is <em>sudden off</em>. As soon as the needle hits your skin and gets dragged you feel the slight pain, and as soon as it comes off your skin you are all relaxed again and forget that it was even there. Of course, there are certain spots along the arm with different pain thresholds, such as where you arm bends, opposite your elbow; it’s very fleshy there and probably the only place besides the triceps area where you might grit your teeth or look away a little!</p>  <p>Personally, I think the most painful part for me was actually getting home an hour later having to run the whole thing under warm soapy water. I jumped in the shower. I think it hurt more than the needle in the way that it activates the pain all over the art work, not just in the one spot the needle is entering. It reddens your arm and makes it feel like you just got a massive sunburn and that pain has still stuck with me over night. But nothing that can’t be lived with for the next few days.</p>  <p>Of course, let’s not forget the preparation before the tattoo. They shaved my arm completely clean; not that I had any hairs there to start with! And then they rub your whole arm in dettol and alcohol. As long as you know how to control your mind and forget pain is there, you’ll be fine. They had to rub my arm clean over 4 times to get the stencil right, so my arm was pretty bright red before even starting the ink work.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERp3OjJ6I/AAAAAAAAAEU/TRKsQ5_CztY/s1600-h/P7180067%5B16%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180067\" height=\"233\" alt=\"P7180067\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/25ef83d073.jpg\" width=\"285\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a> So, what exactly is my tattoo about? Well, I wanted to draw a sword on my right arm. Since in today's day and age in our society, we are not permitted to carry a sword; you’ll find yourself arrested. So, how can I carry a sword that means something to me and my past? Ink it! So, I get a sword designed, and I love a beast called a Tarn in a fantasy series I read, which resembles in our world, an Eagle. Except that they are so large that a human can ride on its back and battle it out in the skies. The handle of my sword is designed with two eagle heads facing away from each other. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERsVF8bII/AAAAAAAAAEc/3XasepCATbc/s1600-h/P7180066%5B7%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180066\" height=\"285\" alt=\"P7180066\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/ea4f4edba1.jpg\" width=\"233\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> Then, I wanted vines and scrolls wrapping the whole sword, so that I could show the meaning of it out to everyone. I put my name on the top, symbolising that it is my sword, and then I put my direct family names down the whole blade. My grandparents on both sides of my family, my mother, father, sister, brother. Should my sword be used (my arm or fist in reality) you will feel the wrath of my whole family. My sword is my honour, it is my life. </p>  <p>Are tattoo’s addictive as the rumour goes? Yes, completely! As much pain as you are going through, they are addictive. I’m already getting my left shoulder designed, which will be a shield; within it my family emblem displaying <em>Lison</em>. And I even have my back design in mind already, but more on that when I get my shield done to match my sword. Don’t want to spoil that post ability!</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Cheers everyone! </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Once this is done I’m getting my family crest designed in tattoo form for my left arm in a shield, and possibly after that a large design on my back which is still sitting in my mind (warrior mounted on a large eagle swooping down with talons open to capture a naked woman in the open fields of grass).</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Because I don’t! I work 50 hour weeks and by the time I get home or the weekend comes around I’m just too buggered. All I want to do is relax and enjoy the weekend while I can; making the most of it. Much like I am doing now – sitting here relaxing on a Friday afternoon as a very nice bloke from Jim’s Mowing who’s still on business hours works on my front and back yard.</p>  <p>As you can see from the photo I took on the right, it look(ed) quite a mess. Since splitting up with my Ex-Girlfriend and her having still lived here for a while I refused to do all the dirty work; which I think is fair?</p>  <p>Ok, so if I did it in the first place, the grass wouldn’t have gotten this bad and I wouldn’t of had to call in Jim’s Mowing to do the work. But these guys do a good job, and they are good on the price.</p>  <p>My front lawn and back lawn cost a total of $70, including weeding. And if I use them on an ongoing basis it’ll cost $50. I know, I’m lazy and should buy a lawn mower. But for shared accommodation? I think it’s a good set up :)</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samlison/3575496574/\"><img title=\"IMG00021\" height=\"245\" alt=\"IMG00021\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/c4d006de93.jpg\" width=\"287\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a></p>  <p>Wouldn’t you agree?

There were not many innovative designs or new models; probably because last years models or before, for many of the companies, are still unsold and sitting around collecting dust? <p>Anyway, I took a few photos of the usual sports cars we see there, including my favourite lotus :P and only my favourite because lotus use  the exact same engine that is in my Toyota.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-5809036281476976125?l=samlison.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",
