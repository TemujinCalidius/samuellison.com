The artistry, storytelling, and sheer skill of the performers left me in awe once again.

It’s heartwarming to see her embrace hiking, and I’m grateful for these moments we share. \n\nI plan to return to the Whipstick Loop Walk in autumn, equipped with my professional camera and sound recording gear, to capture the fungi and the serene atmosphere in all its glory. Until then, this hike remains a cherished memory.\n\n---\n\nWhat’s your favourite hiking trail? Have you had any memorable wildlife encounters? Let me know in the comments!\n\n\n",
