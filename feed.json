So this recap is filled with exciting stuff!</p>\n<p>Take a read :)\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h2 id=\"melbourne-zoo\">Melbourne Zoo</h2>\n<p>We started off on Sunday by going to Melbourne Zoo, just out of the spur of the moment and last minute, some time after lunch.</p>\n<p>It actually ended up being quite busy at the zoo, due to the wonderful weather. In fact, most of this week, even though it is still winter, was reasonably beautiful weather.</p>\n<p>For the zoo, it was sunny and 18 degrees with minimal wind, which made it a comfortable afternoon for everyone.</p>\n<p>The kids really wanted to visit the #butterflies at the zoo, so we did just that. And I managed to snap a photo I&rsquo;m quite happy with:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01041.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"5fdc851a76d5d5e335d011f786bd3389\"\n    title=\"A vibrant blue and black butterfly rests on lush, glossy green leaves, bathed in a patch of sunlight.

If you&rsquo;ve been following me, you have been seeing a steady flow of some of my practice edits and my creativity as I learn.</p>\n<p>I started Monday off with a visit to the dentist though, as I was concerned with some cracks I was getting near the gum line of my teeth. It&rsquo;s something called #abractions and can be caused by both hard brushing or cracking over time due to grinding teeth or the angle your teeth are at causing pressure up near the gum lines. This wears away the enamel over time.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I went and got myself two injections and 3 fillings to cover those up and look like new. My face was numb all the way up my nose :D</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an edit I did of a mushroom on Monday:\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt00128.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"5fdc851a76d5d5e335d011f786bd3389\"\n    title=\"A small, caramel-brown mushroom stands alone on a mossy log, surrounded by soft green moss and blurred forest light.

I really enjoy doing these activities on my own, as when you are playing around with settings on the camera, figuring and learning as you go, it is quite meditative and slows the mind down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01287.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"5fdc851a76d5d5e335d011f786bd3389\"\n    title=\"A rainbow lorikeet hangs upside down from the entrance of a hollow in a pale gum tree, its vibrant green, blue, orange, and yellow feathers bright against the soft, blurred bushland background.

As there&rsquo;s so much to learn. Every photo I take and come back to edit, I learn something new. How could my settings have been better? What composition would have been better? Did I use the correct lens for the job? Is my colour grading off post-editing? What and how do I fix that? I&rsquo;ve used too much contrast and detail, and now it all looks crunchy, how do I fix that?</p>\n<p>It really never ends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01717.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"5fdc851a76d5d5e335d011f786bd3389\"\n    title=\"A Tawny Frogmouth perched motionless against a tree trunk at Brimbank Park, blending seamlessly with the bark.

Your camera is generally within 15cm from your lens tip to your subject. Because you are so close, the subject you are trying to take a photo of is filling up most of your frame on your camera. As you see in my mushroom photos, the subjects take around 40% of the screen or more!</p>\n<p>This means, the camera cannot get everything in focus at once. If you were to turn up your apperture to something like f22 to try and get more in focus in one shot, you would not be letting in enough light for one, but you&rsquo;d also get a lot of what&rsquo;s called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration\">chromatic abberation</a>. I&rsquo;ve linked a wiki article for you to read should you choose. But in lamen terms, colour fringing and the inability for the lens to focus all colours at one point. They are shooting all over the place, blue, red, yellow, and you get a lot of weird colours in your photos, especially along the edges of things.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to focus bracketing.</p>\n<p>So you basically need to do something in the camera called <em>Focus Bracketing</em>. This is a technique where you take multiple photos of the same thing, in the exact same position over and over again (sometimes 50 or 100 times), each time with your focus shifting further and further back in the scene, from the front.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, my new camera has this feature built in, and I only need to tell it where my start point in focus is, how far I want the focus to shift between each photo, and how many shots I want it to take.</p>\n<p>So now you have a stack of photos you are bringing home. They all look the same, besides the focus looks different on each shot. How do you make 1 image out of that?</p>\n<p>Thankfully again, there is software to help do this called <a href=\"https://www.zerenesystems.com/cms/stacker\">Zerene Stacker</a>.</p>\n<p>What the software will do, is something called <em>Focus Stacking</em>. It will take all your photos and use its super powers to put them all into layers, align each one perfectly and merge all of the sharpest points of each photo into 1 final image, which results in the 2 sharp images of the mushrooms I shared above from the Sanatorium Lake walk.</p>\n<p>Camera&rsquo;s and software these days allow you to do other techniques as well. Including exposure bracketing, so that you can get beautiful HDR landscape photos with both the sky and the foreground in the perfect exposures. And you can combine this technique with focus bracketing as well! This is something I will try with landscape in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cape-schanck\">Cape Schanck</h2>\n<p>On Saturday, we ended the week on another high.

So this recap is filled with exciting stuff!\n\nTake a read :)\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n## Melbourne Zoo\nWe started off on Sunday by going to Melbourne Zoo, just out of the spur of the moment and last minute, some time after lunch.\n\nIt actually ended up being quite busy at the zoo, due to the wonderful weather. In fact, most of this week, even though it is still winter, was reasonably beautiful weather. \n\nFor the zoo, it was sunny and 18 degrees with minimal wind, which made it a comfortable afternoon for everyone.\n\nThe kids really wanted to visit the #butterflies at the zoo, so we did just that. And I managed to snap a photo I'm quite happy with:\n\n![A vibrant blue and black butterfly rests on lush, glossy green leaves, bathed in a patch of sunlight. The butterfly’s wings shimmer with iridescent spots, creating a striking contrast against the deep green foliage.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01041.jpg \"A vibrant blue and black butterfly rests on lush, glossy green leaves, bathed in a patch of sunlight. The butterfly’s wings shimmer with iridescent spots, creating a striking contrast against the deep green foliage.\")\n\n## Days to Self\nOn Monday, being a week day, I had some time to myself that I used to edit some of my photographs that I had taken the week before, and share on my various channels. If you've been following me, you have been seeing a steady flow of some of my practice edits and my creativity as I learn.\n\nI started Monday off with a visit to the dentist though, as I was concerned with some cracks I was getting near the gum line of my teeth. It's something called #abractions and can be caused by both hard brushing or cracking over time due to grinding teeth or the angle your teeth are at causing pressure up near the gum lines. This wears away the enamel over time.\n\nAnyway, I went and got myself two injections and 3 fillings to cover those up and look like new. My face was numb all the way up my nose :D\n\nHere's an edit I did of a mushroom on Monday:\n![A small, caramel-brown mushroom stands alone on a mossy log, surrounded by soft green moss and blurred forest light. The scene captures the delicate beauty of fungi in the Wombat State Forest, with the mushroom’s cap glistening gently and the background fading into dreamy, blue-green bokeh.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt00128.jpg \"A small, caramel-brown mushroom stands alone on a mossy log, surrounded by soft green moss and blurred forest light. The scene captures the delicate beauty of fungi in the Wombat State Forest, with the mushroom’s cap glistening gently and the background fading into dreamy, blue-green bokeh.\")\n\n## Brimbank Park\nWith a new 150-600mm telephoto lens, I also took a few days visiting my local #BrimbankPark to take photos of birds and wildlife in the area. I really enjoy doing these activities on my own, as when you are playing around with settings on the camera, figuring and learning as you go, it is quite meditative and slows the mind down.\n\n![A rainbow lorikeet hangs upside down from the entrance of a hollow in a pale gum tree, its vibrant green, blue, orange, and yellow feathers bright against the soft, blurred bushland background. The playful bird explores the tree cavity in the dappled sunlight at Brimbank Park.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01287.jpg \"A rainbow lorikeet hangs upside down from the entrance of a hollow in a pale gum tree, its vibrant green, blue, orange, and yellow feathers bright against the soft, blurred bushland background. The playful bird explores the tree cavity in the dappled sunlight at Brimbank Park.\")\n\nMy mind tends to go all over the place, and I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things, and tend to get bored of things quickly if they are no longer a challenge and become too repetitive. \n\nI'm glad I got to practice on an old camera before investing into my new equipment, because I've committed a full year into photography as a hobby already... a majority of that on the old #Nikon #D7000 #DSLR. \n\nI can tell that photography is a hobby that will stay with me for a long time. As there's so much to learn. Every photo I take and come back to edit, I learn something new. How could my settings have been better? What composition would have been better? Did I use the correct lens for the job? Is my colour grading off post-editing? What and how do I fix that? I've used too much contrast and detail, and now it all looks crunchy, how do I fix that? \n\nIt really never ends.\n\n![A Tawny Frogmouth perched motionless against a tree trunk at Brimbank Park, blending seamlessly with the bark. Its mottled grey and brown feathers provide natural camouflage in the dappled daylight.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01717.jpg \"A Tawny Frogmouth perched motionless against a tree trunk at Brimbank Park, blending seamlessly with the bark. Its mottled grey and brown feathers provide natural camouflage in the dappled daylight.\")\n\nI've played around with a variety of photography styles now. Starting off with pure macro of fungi, then also trying out these bird photos.\n\nI've gone from looking down at the ground for little mushrooms, to looking up into the trees with the change of season. \n\n![A European Rabbit sits alert on a grassy bank at Brimbank Park, surrounded by soft green foliage. Its brown fur blends with the earth, highlighting its natural camouflage in the Australian landscape.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt01900.jpg \"A European Rabbit sits alert on a grassy bank at Brimbank Park, surrounded by soft green foliage.

I know you are reading this!), I like to take the opportunity to spend more time with her. \n\nThe beauty about my line of work is that I get a lot of my days off on week days, when everyone is at work, but my mother is at home twiddling her thumbs (or painting in her studio!) - so it's a perfect opportunity to just go for a walk out in nature.\n\nOf course, I wouldn't miss a chance to bring the camera gear while out as well, especially on hikes I have done numerous times before and know back to front, and know that I have enough time to explore while walking.\n\n![An Eastern Yellow Robin perched on a mossy branch at Mount Macedon, its bright yellow belly and soft grey head standing out against the dark green forest background.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt02086.jpg \"An Eastern Yellow Robin perched on a mossy branch at Mount Macedon, its bright yellow belly and soft grey head standing out against the dark green forest background.\")\n\nWe actually went out with a specific goal on this walk, and that was to find a mushroom called the **Pixie's Parasol**.

Your camera is generally within 15cm from your lens tip to your subject. Because you are so close, the subject you are trying to take a photo of is filling up most of your frame on your camera. As you see in my mushroom photos, the subjects take around 40% of the screen or more!\n\nThis means, the camera cannot get everything in focus at once. If you were to turn up your apperture to something like f22 to try and get more in focus in one shot, you would not be letting in enough light for one, but you'd also get a lot of what's called [chromatic abberation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration).

They are shooting all over the place, blue, red, yellow, and you get a lot of weird colours in your photos, especially along the edges of things.\n\nAnyway, back to focus bracketing.\n\nSo you basically need to do something in the camera called *Focus Bracketing*. This is a technique where you take multiple photos of the same thing, in the exact same position over and over again (sometimes 50 or 100 times), each time with your focus shifting further and further back in the scene, from the front.\n\nThankfully, my new camera has this feature built in, and I only need to tell it where my start point in focus is, how far I want the focus to shift between each photo, and how many shots I want it to take.\n\nSo now you have a stack of photos you are bringing home. They all look the same, besides the focus looks different on each shot. How do you make 1 image out of that?\n\nThankfully again, there is software to help do this called [Zerene Stacker](https://www.zerenesystems.com/cms/stacker).\n\nWhat the software will do, is something called *Focus Stacking*. It will take all your photos and use its super powers to put them all into layers, align each one perfectly and merge all of the sharpest points of each photo into 1 final image, which results in the 2 sharp images of the mushrooms I shared above from the Sanatorium Lake walk.\n\nCamera's and software these days allow you to do other techniques as well. Including exposure bracketing, so that you can get beautiful HDR landscape photos with both the sky and the foreground in the perfect exposures. And you can combine this technique with focus bracketing as well! This is something I will try with landscape in the future.\n\n## Cape Schanck\nOn Saturday, we ended the week on another high.

But they pushed through, and in the end, got to see some beautiful scenery that they never would have seen had they given up.\n\n![Cape Schanck Lighthouse rises above rugged cliffs, overlooking the sparkling Bass Strait. Sunlight streams across the ocean and dense coastal scrub, capturing the wild beauty of Victoria’s southern tip.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/dmt02328.jpg \"Cape Schanck Lighthouse rises above rugged cliffs, overlooking the sparkling Bass Strait. Sunlight streams across the ocean and dense coastal scrub, capturing the wild beauty of Victoria’s southern tip.\")\n\nWe even got to spot an #echidna that wasn't afraid of humans and hung around hunting for ants for a good half hour.\n\nI'll likely share more of these photos with you in the next recap, as I technically didn't edit them during this recap time period, and I don't want to take away from this weeks choice of photo of the week! Which was that of my Yellowleg Bonnet Mushroom!\n\n## Task Completion\nI am adding this section here again this week, as it keeps me on track and responsible to myself. \n\nThis week, I hit a good success rate again in task completion for myself.\n\nI completed 79% of my tasks (33 out of 42). I'm proud of that again this week, and need to keep this up again for next week!\n\nI'll have a monthly recap to write about in the end of August, and hopefully that will tell me overall, how well I have been doing so far, not just week to week.\n\nI shared a total of 9 photos this week, which is good. More than 1 photo per day. That's a steady stream of edits and practice over the week, and again, getting better each time (in my opinion).\n\nI've shared 5 random short posts with you all. Which again, just means I'm not that active on social media just posting random things. There's enough information in my weekly recaps anyway, and much more detail for you to read!\n\n## Conclusion\nYet again, thank you for reading to the end if you did so. I'd love to get your feedback, any comments, suggestions or thoughts.\n\nAnd until next time, see you next week!\n",

They are tiny little birds (like sparrows) and zip around so fast hunting for bugs.</p>\n<p>My camera was set to 1/4000 shutter speed here with a 105mm macro prime lens made for (obviously) macro photography and detailed portraits.</p>\n<p>The original image is about 6 x the size of the one you see, and the bird is tiny in the original image. This image was cropped to where you see it now, and still managed to capture enough detail to identify the bird.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased. And obviously this is me coming from a really old camera and getting my hands on something game changing. Photographers that have always kept their cameras up to date would not notice such a jump in detail as I have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"artvo\">Artvo</h2>\n<p>On Saturday, I took the family our to Docklands to visit #Artvo and the #IceSkating ring afterwards. The kids had a blast!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artvo.com.au/\">Artvo</a> is a 3D art exhibition that you can pose within and when photos are taken, they look like you are part of the scene. When we went, all the art was in fantasy style. It enabled the kids to have fun, while I played around with different settings on the camera. I ended up with more than 1000 photos to pick from. Then I had to edit them, as I wanted more than what the JPG&rsquo;s offered! I picked 84 or so photos from the lot.</p>\n<p>A majority of the photos were actually because I had the camera setup for burst shooting. I felt like the paparazzi with the mechanical shutter going off so fast!</p>\n<h2 id=\"task-progress\">Task Progress</h2>\n<p>Having come off night shift and being able to get myself into some kind of daily routine has seen me successfully complete a majority of my daily tasks I set out for myself.</p>\n<p>I ticked off 71% of my tasks for the week, completing 30 out of 42 tasks over the last 7 days. Not a bad effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-stats\">Other Stats</h2>\n<p><strong>Total Observations this week:</strong> 0\n<strong>Total thoughts posted this week:</strong> 7\n<strong>Total Photos this week:</strong> 3</p>\n<p>Looking at the stats, I can improve on the observations for one. I know I had more than zero, and actually posted 11 observations over at <a href=\"https://inaturalist.org\">iNaturalist</a>. I just haven&rsquo;t added them to my personal #Obsidian database! So I can go ahead and fix that going forward. All I did was post them to iNaturalist, and what I really want to be doing is noting down more scientific detail about them and keeping notes for myself and paying more attention to what it is I am looking at.</p>\n<p>As for thoughts, those are just the amount of short posts I made on my blog and other linked social media. Not so concerned about that stat, but it does show me how active I&rsquo;ve been sharing things with others, which are not photographs.</p>\n<p>Photos are the amounts of photos I have edited and shared online. It doesn&rsquo;t account for how many photos I have actually taken and edited, which this week would be somewhere over 100. I will pick my favourites for sharing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Once again, thank you for reading this far, and as always, comments are welcome. I enjoy reading your thoughts and opinions. Makes it feel less lonely out here on the inter-webs.</p>\n",

The lighting highlights the mushroom’s textured cap and the fine details of the moss below, capturing the delicate beauty of fungi in their natural habitat.\")\n\nAnd here is my second attempt, this one was only 47 images:\n![Tiny orange-brown mushroom growing from moss on a tree trunk, with a soft green background and delicate fern-like moss cascading down the bark.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/2025-07-31-10.18.06-zs-retouched.jpg \"Tiny orange-brown mushroom growing from moss on a tree trunk, with a soft green background and delicate fern-like moss cascading down the bark.\")\n\nI was also amazed with how much detail I was able to get out of a photo of a #WelcomeSwallow.\n\n![Test Bird photo. Little fellow cropped in.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/20250729-0068.jpg \"Test Bird photo. Little fellow cropped in.\")\n\nThis photo was taken on day 1 with my camera using the wrong lens for the job. A Welcome Swallow is no more than 90g in weight. They are tiny little birds (like sparrows) and zip around so fast hunting for bugs.\n\nMy camera was set to 1/4000 shutter speed here with a 105mm macro prime lens made for (obviously) macro photography and detailed portraits.\n\nThe original image is about 6 x the size of the one you see, and the bird is tiny in the original image. This image was cropped to where you see it now, and still managed to capture enough detail to identify the bird.\n\nI'm really pleased. And obviously this is me coming from a really old camera and getting my hands on something game changing. Photographers that have always kept their cameras up to date would not notice such a jump in detail as I have.\n\n## Artvo\nOn Saturday, I took the family our to Docklands to visit #Artvo and the #IceSkating ring afterwards. The kids had a blast!\n\n[Artvo](https://www.artvo.com.au/) is a 3D art exhibition that you can pose within and when photos are taken, they look like you are part of the scene. When we went, all the art was in fantasy style. It enabled the kids to have fun, while I played around with different settings on the camera. I ended up with more than 1000 photos to pick from. Then I had to edit them, as I wanted more than what the JPG's offered! I picked 84 or so photos from the lot.\n\nA majority of the photos were actually because I had the camera setup for burst shooting. I felt like the paparazzi with the mechanical shutter going off so fast!\n\n## Task Progress\nHaving come off night shift and being able to get myself into some kind of daily routine has seen me successfully complete a majority of my daily tasks I set out for myself. \n\nI ticked off 71% of my tasks for the week, completing 30 out of 42 tasks over the last 7 days. Not a bad effort.\n\n## Other Stats\n**Total Observations this week:** 0\n**Total thoughts posted this week:** 7\n**Total Photos this week:** 3\n\nLooking at the stats, I can improve on the observations for one. I know I had more than zero, and actually posted 11 observations over at [iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org). I just haven't added them to my personal #Obsidian database! So I can go ahead and fix that going forward. All I did was post them to iNaturalist, and what I really want to be doing is noting down more scientific detail about them and keeping notes for myself and paying more attention to what it is I am looking at.\n\nAs for thoughts, those are just the amount of short posts I made on my blog and other linked social media. Not so concerned about that stat, but it does show me how active I've been sharing things with others, which are not photographs.\n\nPhotos are the amounts of photos I have edited and shared online. It doesn't account for how many photos I have actually taken and edited, which this week would be somewhere over 100. I will pick my favourites for sharing!\n\n## Conclusion\nOnce again, thank you for reading this far, and as always, comments are welcome. I enjoy reading your thoughts and opinions. Makes it feel less lonely out here on the inter-webs.\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><strong>Tasks Completed:</strong> 34/42 (81% Completion)\n<strong>Total Observations:</strong> 1\n<strong>Total Thoughts Posted:</strong> 12\n<strong>Total Photos Posted:</strong> 1</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with this weeks task accomplishments. I managed to complete 34 out of my weekly 42 tasks I had set out. That&rsquo;s an 81% completion rate!</p>\n<p>What are these tasks though? Well, they are daily routines that I wish to accomplish before the end of the day. These include things like meditation, exercise and reading, along with a few other things. A usual routine, that I should be able to accomplish daily without excuse!</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<h1 id=\"the-turning-point\">The Turning Point</h1>\n<p>Sunday for me was a turning point. I spent most of it working on #Obsidian and my #Journal in general. I needed to focus on my daily tasks more and bring my task completion rates up.</p>\n<p>My tasks are there for a reason. They are goals I wish to tick off on a daily basis, with the most important ones being to meditate and to exercise to stay healthy in mind and body.</p>\n<p>I felt that I was procrastinating too much and could not find a reason or an excuse as to why I am this way. Is it simply that I may have attention deficit disorder, and outside of work, I find it hard to focus on one thing? That I cannot do the same thing over and over for long periods of time? Is that a thing?</p>\n<p>Either way, I felt frustrated about this and have done some work to make my journaling and my task tracking more enjoyable and accountable to me.</p>\n<p>So on Monday, I started the new journal system, which included looking at the previous days planning and self reflection.</p>\n<p>Self reflection includes taking note of my mood that given day when waking up (using an emoji), and my energy level on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>\n<p>I would then spend a quick minute just taking note of that days weather forecast and any fire danger ratings. In case out of the blue, I intend to just go out bush for time to myself.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I would also reflect, by taking note of any <em>Highlight or Gratitude</em> by just writing it and putting it out into the nether.</p>\n<h1 id=\"photo-of-the-week\">Photo of the Week</h1>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also got sections to showcase to myself my favourite photo of the day that I took or edited, and to note my favourite observation that I added to my catalogue.</p>\n<p>Of course, I understand I wont be taking or editing photos on a daily basis, nor would I be hiking and observing species of fungi on a daily basis. But when I do, I can reflect on those in the weekly, monthly, yearly recaps and pick my favourites and talk about them, and why I chose them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So here&rsquo;s my favourite edit from this week! This was actually a part of my latest shots taken on one of my #LerderdergGorge hikes and the image wasn&rsquo;t one of my original favourites. It&rsquo;s one of the images I actually left until last to edit.</p>\n<p>I cropped it into a 1:1 image as I felt the composition worked best for this shot, and I wanted to give monochrome a go. I actually love how it turned out! I brought the colours back out on the mushroom itself, leaving the background black and white. I am in love with this photo so much that I just might print myself a small copy to place on my desk.</p>\n<p>I believe the mushroom type is that of bonnet.

				"content_text": "\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1653.jpg\">\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@sporetrail@mastodon.social\">\n\n**Tasks Completed:** 34/42 (81% Completion)\n**Total Observations:** 1\n**Total Thoughts Posted:** 12\n**Total Photos Posted:** 1\n\nI'm quite happy with this weeks task accomplishments. I managed to complete 34 out of my weekly 42 tasks I had set out. That's an 81% completion rate!\n\nWhat are these tasks though? Well, they are daily routines that I wish to accomplish before the end of the day. These include things like meditation, exercise and reading, along with a few other things. A usual routine, that I should be able to accomplish daily without excuse!\n\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n# The Turning Point\nSunday for me was a turning point. I spent most of it working on #Obsidian and my #Journal in general. I needed to focus on my daily tasks more and bring my task completion rates up.\n\nMy tasks are there for a reason. They are goals I wish to tick off on a daily basis, with the most important ones being to meditate and to exercise to stay healthy in mind and body. \n\nI felt that I was procrastinating too much and could not find a reason or an excuse as to why I am this way. Is it simply that I may have attention deficit disorder, and outside of work, I find it hard to focus on one thing? That I cannot do the same thing over and over for long periods of time? Is that a thing?\n\nEither way, I felt frustrated about this and have done some work to make my journaling and my task tracking more enjoyable and accountable to me.\n\nSo on Monday, I started the new journal system, which included looking at the previous days planning and self reflection.\n\nSelf reflection includes taking note of my mood that given day when waking up (using an emoji), and my energy level on a scale of 1 to 10. \n\nI would then spend a quick minute just taking note of that days weather forecast and any fire danger ratings. In case out of the blue, I intend to just go out bush for time to myself.\n\nAt the end of the day, I would also reflect, by taking note of any *Highlight or Gratitude* by just writing it and putting it out into the nether.\n\n# Photo of the Week\nI've also got sections to showcase to myself my favourite photo of the day that I took or edited, and to note my favourite observation that I added to my catalogue.\n\nOf course, I understand I wont be taking or editing photos on a daily basis, nor would I be hiking and observing species of fungi on a daily basis. But when I do, I can reflect on those in the weekly, monthly, yearly recaps and pick my favourites and talk about them, and why I chose them.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/jdm-2655.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Sony AR7V\">\n\t<figcaption>A small, golden-yellow mushroom stands out in vivid colour against a monochrome background of textured wood and blurred forest. The mushroom emerges from a crack in the log, drawing the eye with its saturated cap and delicate stem. Photographed at Lerderderg State Park.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo here's my favourite edit from this week! This was actually a part of my latest shots taken on one of my #LerderdergGorge hikes and the image wasn't one of my original favourites. It's one of the images I actually left until last to edit. \n\nI cropped it into a 1:1 image as I felt the composition worked best for this shot, and I wanted to give monochrome a go. I actually love how it turned out! I brought the colours back out on the mushroom itself, leaving the background black and white. I am in love with this photo so much that I just might print myself a small copy to place on my desk.\n\nI believe the mushroom type is that of bonnet. I should have really taken more photos of this one and uploaded to [iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org)!\n\n# Observation of the Week\nThis week's observation was also at #LerderdergGorge during a last minute hike.\n\n![A vibrant orange-brown mushroom viewed from below, showing its pale gills and sturdy stem as it emerges from a decaying log in Lerderderg Gorge.

Still a long way to go for me, but I am happy with the progress and my workflow!\n\nHere's a gallery of the photos I took this week:\n\n<div class=\"img-gallery\">\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1948.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A meerkat sits upright on a sunlit rock at Melbourne Zoo, gazing alertly upwards with a background of blurred green foliage and dappled light.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1756.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A female gorilla sits on green grass at Melbourne Zoo, holding and examining a leafy branch with one hand, surrounded by lush foliage.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1763.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A male silverback gorilla sits on a bed of straw and hessian in a shaded area at Melbourne Zoo, surrounded by dense green foliage and rocky shelter.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1877.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A young baboon lies on its back on woodchip ground at Melbourne Zoo, legs in the air and mouth open in a playful expression, with sunlight highlighting its fur.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1935-01.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A red panda stands on a tree branch at Melbourne Zoo, surrounded by vibrant autumn leaves and a bright blue sky, looking curiously toward the camera.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1913.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A crocodile’s head is partially submerged in clear water at Melbourne Zoo, blending with mossy rocks and overhanging green ferns.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1771.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A butterfly with striking orange and black wings rests on a broad, glossy green leaf at Melbourne Zoo, viewed from above.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1773.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A butterfly with dark brown wings, orange edges, and white spots rests on a large, glossy green leaf at Melbourne Zoo.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1785.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A butterfly with dark wings featuring orange and white markings perches on the edge of a ribbed green leaf at Melbourne Zoo, wings spread as if about to fly.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1789.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A butterfly with iridescent blue-purple wings and white spots rests on a green leaf at Melbourne Zoo, surrounded by soft-focus foliage.\" >}}\n  {{<glightbox src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1795.jpg\" gallery=\"010625\" alt=\"A butterfly with black wings and bright blue spots rests on a dried plant stem at Melbourne Zoo, surrounded by lush green leaves.\" >}}\n</div>\n\nAnd this is my favourite image of the day.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1777.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Golden Contrast\">\n\t<figcaption>Golden Contrast - Beautiful butterfly sitting on a beautifully textured leaf and surrounds.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAll in all, these photo's were stunning to my eye and I enjoyed the process within DarkTable to bring these RAW images to life. The old #Nikon #D7000 may be going on 15 years old and is still a #DSLR with mirror, and may not have the quality of the latest smart phones, but it was still great for what I managed to do with it, with the lens I am limited to using.\n\nYou can grab these photos for FREE, including in .TIF full quality format for print quality up to A3 I think from memory. And if you want to support my work, I do appreciate donations to the value you feel my work is worth to your eye - or even a monthly contribution. \n\nYou can visit my Ko-Fi page at [https://ko-fi.com/samuellison](https://ko-fi.com/samuellison). \n\n## Conclusion\nThanks for reading up to here, and I look forward to more exciting days to come!\n\nI have 6 more days off work to go and plan on going on small walks and hikes by myself and with my mother.\n",

It will be much more forgiving for me, and due to the fact that I can do macro with 61 megapixels and, if I find I need to, I have plenty of detail to be able to crop in and still get pristine images.</p>\n<p>This purchase would last me a very long time. And I feel much more comfortable investing in some good lenses for a camera I own, over purchasing lenses for the Nikon I am currently using, which is not mine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-tech-m2-ssd-upgrade\">More Tech (M.2 SSD Upgrade)</h2>\n<p>I went ahead and purchased a new 2TB M.2 SSD to plug into my mothyerboard, which will replace the 512gb one I have currently.</p>\n<p>This is so that when I do my photography and videos, I can drag all my raw and unedited content there for post-editing. This will allow me to do my photo editing in #DarkTable much fast than working with files over the network on the NAS. Same with video editing.</p>\n<p>While shopping for this SSD, I realised however, that bus speeds have progressed on motherboards and that my motherboard is now quite ancient. They have PCIe 5.0 now, which would upgrade my SSD speed from around 3,000MB/s to 14,000MB/s!</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s phenomenal. Unfortunately though, that means I need a motherboard upgrade that has PCIe M.2 slots. And that also means the CPU needs upgrading to the new socket types, as well as my memory going from DDR4 to DDR5. I can&rsquo;t use the same CPU and memory in modern motherboards.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I will keep my old 512gig M.2 SSD for when I do upgrade my motherboard in future. As I will be able to re-use that, I believe! And get myself one of those new fancy PCIe 5.0 versions for the editing drive.  That&rsquo;ll put me on 4 x M.2 drives by the time I am ready for the upgrade.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Another week gone for 2025. Almost half way. Amazing how quick a year can escape you before you realise it&rsquo;s gone.</p>\n<p>Make the most of it everyone!</p>\n",

And I feel much more comfortable investing in some good lenses for a camera I own, over purchasing lenses for the Nikon I am currently using, which is not mine.\n\n## More Tech (M.2 SSD Upgrade)\nI went ahead and purchased a new 2TB M.2 SSD to plug into my mothyerboard, which will replace the 512gb one I have currently. \n\nThis is so that when I do my photography and videos, I can drag all my raw and unedited content there for post-editing. This will allow me to do my photo editing in #DarkTable much fast than working with files over the network on the NAS. Same with video editing.\n\nWhile shopping for this SSD, I realised however, that bus speeds have progressed on motherboards and that my motherboard is now quite ancient. They have PCIe 5.0 now, which would upgrade my SSD speed from around 3,000MB/s to 14,000MB/s!\n\nThat's phenomenal. Unfortunately though, that means I need a motherboard upgrade that has PCIe M.2 slots. And that also means the CPU needs upgrading to the new socket types, as well as my memory going from DDR4 to DDR5. I can't use the same CPU and memory in modern motherboards.\n\nAnyway, I will keep my old 512gig M.2 SSD for when I do upgrade my motherboard in future. As I will be able to re-use that, I believe! And get myself one of those new fancy PCIe 5.0 versions for the editing drive.  That'll put me on 4 x M.2 drives by the time I am ready for the upgrade.\n\n## Conclusion\nAnother week gone for 2025. Almost half way. Amazing how quick a year can escape you before you realise it's gone. \n\nMake the most of it everyone!\n",

I mean, it&rsquo;s almost the end of spring now, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Daylesford\">Lake Daylesford</a> has never ceased to amaze me with its flourish of mushrooms. The beautiful red and white spotted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria\">Amanita Muscaria</a> are usually always there this time of year, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suillus\">Slippery Jacks</a>.</p>\n<p>This year however, it seems there was a bit of a drought.

This is concerning.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I took my mother to Lake Daylesford and we had a wonderful walk around the lake. I didn&rsquo;t manage to snap any high quality photos of mushrooms, and yes, I did find a <em>single</em> Amanita out there on its own, but I didn&rsquo;t manage to get a good photo using my camera. I did get a sneaky shot on my phone though.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250514-120251.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250514-120251.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A vibrant red mushroom, possibly an amanita, is growing on the forest floor surrounded by grass and trees.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Other than that photo though, I did manage to snap and edit some beautiful shots of the lake and surrounds.</p>\n<p>I am most proud of this one from the day. The colours really came out well post-edit and I like the composition.

The lonely bench with no one sitting on it currently, looking over the waters. I like how the plants up ahead in the lake just happened to align with the bench though. Again, I could have centred it better post-editing.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1645.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1645.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A wooden bench is situated under leafy trees, overlooking a tranquil lake with vegetation on the opposite shore.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>I loved this overall shot of the lake. I didn&rsquo;t have a wide enough lens with me to really capture it all, but now thinking about it, I should have zoomed in more and captured the area to the left reaching over to the centre of the photo and captured more detail there, perhaps centering the largest tree there to the image. Maybe next time!\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1626.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1626.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A serene lake reflects a tree-lined shore and vibrant autumn foliage under a clear blue sky.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Actually, below is an edit of that photo just to see. Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t currently have a powerful enough camera to crop in so much and I lose a lot of the detail. Still cannot wait to get my new camera! And looking at the photo again, I should show the full reflection of that tree in the water too!

I noticed a young boy fishing and setting up his rod. The reflection of the sun in the water was nice and I felt this photo looked best in a black and white setting, making the boy look more like a silhouette style photo.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1650.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1650.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A person is fishing on the edge of a calm lake surrounded by trees, with the water reflecting sunlight.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Before leaving Lake Daylesford, I then took my mother to the local botanical garden known as <a href=\"https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/daylesford-and-the-macedon-ranges/see-and-do/nature-and-wildlife/parks-and-gardens/wombat-hill-botanic-gardens\">Wombat Hill Botanical Garden</a>. I really loved the way the leaves fallen on the floor were turning yellow and adding such nice contrast in colours along the dirt pathway in there, so I took a moment to try and capture that in a photograph.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1671.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1671.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A serene forest pathway is surrounded by tall trees with leaves turning shades of green and yellow.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>If you like any of the photos that you see, you can grab them for free or <em>&ldquo;buy me a coffee</em>&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/samuellison/shop\">visiting my Ko-Fi</a> page.</p>\n<p>What do you think of my photos?</p>\n<h2 id=\"gaming---sea-of-thieves\">Gaming - Sea of Thieves</h2>\n<p>I started playing a new game with an online friend of mine. The game is called <a href=\"https://www.seaofthieves.com\">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The game is pretty cool. You play as a pirate and the objective obviously is to go around looking for treasures and getting involved in a lot of piracy by stealing loot from other players as well.</p>\n<p>You sail the seas in a ship that requires other people to be with you to assist with tasks on the ship. Such as someone to captain and steer the ship, someone to manage the sails, someone to fire the cannons and someone to manage any damage to your ship.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s pretty addictive, I will admit. However, they ruined the game by adding loads of micro-transactions that you can purchase with real money which then completely takes away from the game as a whole.</p>\n<p>You see, the micro-transactions allow you to purchase cosmetic upgrades to your character, equipment and ship. You would think that this in itself wouldn&rsquo;t ruin a game, as this doesn&rsquo;t make it pay to win.</p>\n<p>However, this whole game, there are no skills or levelling involved, and a fresh player has the same abilities and strengths as a veteran player. The whole objective of this game is to loot treasures and make coins, which you can use in supply shops to purchase new cosmetic upgrades to your character, ship and equipment.</p>\n<p>So if you go ahead and purchase these with real money, the rest of the game just suddenly becomes boring with no more progression.</p>\n<p>This explains also why this game has huge issues with cheats. Even with their so called anti-cheat system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vibe-coding\">Vibe Coding</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a lot of AI to assist me with the coding of this blog. Since I do not have the knowledge to do it all myself.</p>\n<p>This week I did more updating to the blog, including adding a new feature that allows my images to be clicked on to load a type of lightbox, enlarged image with alt text showing beneath it.</p>\n<p>I also made more updates to the home page where latest posts and replies show. #Hashtags and such will now auto link so that you can search them for recent posts syndicated into <a href=\"https://mastodon.social\">Mastodon.social</a>.

And looking at the photo again, I should show the full reflection of that tree in the water too! Live and learn!\n![A tranquil lakeside scene features a red-roofed building and trees with vibrant foliage reflected in the water under a clear blue sky.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/b562ccb216.jpg)\n\nThen I tried something new for me by taking a photo directly into the sun. I noticed a young boy fishing and setting up his rod. The reflection of the sun in the water was nice and I felt this photo looked best in a black and white setting, making the boy look more like a silhouette style photo.\n![A person is fishing on the edge of a calm lake surrounded by trees, with the water reflecting sunlight.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1650.jpg)\n\nBefore leaving Lake Daylesford, I then took my mother to the local botanical garden known as [Wombat Hill Botanical Garden](https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/daylesford-and-the-macedon-ranges/see-and-do/nature-and-wildlife/parks-and-gardens/wombat-hill-botanic-gardens). I really loved the way the leaves fallen on the floor were turning yellow and adding such nice contrast in colours along the dirt pathway in there, so I took a moment to try and capture that in a photograph.\n![A serene forest pathway is surrounded by tall trees with leaves turning shades of green and yellow.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1671.jpg)\n\nIf you like any of the photos that you see, you can grab them for free or *\"buy me a coffee*\" by [visiting my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/samuellison/shop) page. \n\nWhat do you think of my photos? \n\n\n## Gaming - Sea of Thieves\nI started playing a new game with an online friend of mine. The game is called [Sea of Thieves](https://www.seaofthieves.com).\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/sea-of-thieves-review-vvcm.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A pirate ship is being fired upon by cannons in a vibrant ocean setting.\">\n<figcaption>Screenshot of the game, Sea of Thieves. Source - IGN.com</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe game is pretty cool. You play as a pirate and the objective obviously is to go around looking for treasures and getting involved in a lot of piracy by stealing loot from other players as well.\n\nYou sail the seas in a ship that requires other people to be with you to assist with tasks on the ship. Such as someone to captain and steer the ship, someone to manage the sails, someone to fire the cannons and someone to manage any damage to your ship.\n\nIt's pretty addictive, I will admit. However, they ruined the game by adding loads of micro-transactions that you can purchase with real money which then completely takes away from the game as a whole.\n\nYou see, the micro-transactions allow you to purchase cosmetic upgrades to your character, equipment and ship. You would think that this in itself wouldn't ruin a game, as this doesn't make it pay to win.\n\nHowever, this whole game, there are no skills or levelling involved, and a fresh player has the same abilities and strengths as a veteran player. The whole objective of this game is to loot treasures and make coins, which you can use in supply shops to purchase new cosmetic upgrades to your character, ship and equipment.\n\nSo if you go ahead and purchase these with real money, the rest of the game just suddenly becomes boring with no more progression.\n\nThis explains also why this game has huge issues with cheats. Even with their so called anti-cheat system.\n\n\n## Vibe Coding\nI've been using a lot of AI to assist me with the coding of this blog. Since I do not have the knowledge to do it all myself.\n\nThis week I did more updating to the blog, including adding a new feature that allows my images to be clicked on to load a type of lightbox, enlarged image with alt text showing beneath it. \n\nI also made more updates to the home page where latest posts and replies show. #Hashtags and such will now auto link so that you can search them for recent posts syndicated into [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social). Any webmentions and links also work through this page without having to open the individual posts.\n\n\n## Daughters Birthday\nMy daughter Zoey had her 11th birthday! We went with 10 of us to play some #LaserTag and it was awesome fun. I haven't played laser tag in more than 10 years now and it brought back fond memories.\n\nThe kids absolutely loved the day. After laser tag we spent some of the afternoon in the arcade section and earning tickets to spend on sweets and little toys.\n\nWe would have done some #GoKarting, but didn't realise it had gotten so expensive! They want $50 now for a session!\n\n\n## SL Colonies\n[SL Colonies](https://slcolonies.com) is my Indie Game that I have been developing with a coding friend for more than 6 years. It's an #RPG system with crafting and survival that was made to work within the [Second Life](https://secondlife.com) platform. Part of the #metaverse. \n\nAnyway, we finally finished making a full questing system for the game that allows RPG world builders to fully build quests and story-lines from scratch.\n\nCan't wait to see this new system in action by our community!\n\n\n## Conclusion\nEvery week I get to the recap writing, and always look at what I've done briefly and think that I am not going to have much to write about - but I seem to always prove myself wrong.\nThere's always so much to recap on that I enjoy typing and going through what I accomplished and what I did not accomplish.\n\nAlthough I didn't do a lot of my tasks, such as my daily exercises and meditation and readings, I feel I have still been productive enough all in all. \n\nOk, while the wording *productive* might not be the best example, the life experiences are still there. I wouldn't really think twice about what I've done over the week if I didn't #journal and #microblog about everything on a daily basis, and then write about the whole week. It really puts a different perspective on life and I highly recommend you guys get into it. \n\nIt's funner than I thought, that's for sure!\n",

Again, I thought nothing too much of it. I tried internet speed test, my connection was perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>This happened more than 10 times. Every time I would try to time it, nothing. I got to a point where I realised what was going on, and I would laugh out loud to myself in my vacant home and just make it do it for kicks&hellip; stop timing it, and then pauses&hellip; time it, no pauses&hellip;</p>\n<p>This was not all that occurred though.

So glad my CPU made it through all those years without overheating!</p>\n<p>Removing the sticker improved my system performance significantly and I was off and away back into streaming and making videos for our game <a href=\"https://slcolonies.com\">SL Colonies</a>. But that wasn&rsquo;t before adding a liquid cooled upgrade on my list of things I wanted for the PC.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So I went and finally purchased a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BQWSP2ZP\">Corsair iCUE Liquid CPU Cooler</a> this week with an LCD display, and installed it. What do you think? And now the temperatures on the PC hover around 25 and 26 Celsius constantly. I haven&rsquo;t yet had the opportunity to fully stress test the system with heavy CPU workload, but this is nice, and it really compliments the whole look.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ethernet-issues-gone\">Ethernet Issues Gone</h4>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to report that my <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/24/so-lately-i-have-been.html\">Ethernet issues</a> I had been having for a few months now are gone. I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. I thought it was my <a href=\"https://system76.com/pop/\">Linux distribution</a> causing issues at the kernel level with my Ethernet going to sleep or being managed by the system somehow.</p>\n<p>Basically, randomly, my network would die on the PC, and the only way to get it back, was to physically unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it back in. Not even turning Ethernet on and off seemed to work. And it was happening at random times, not just when walking away from the PC; I could be in the middle of working and the network would go offline.</p>\n<p>This was an issue, as I need a stable connection for my daily needs. Especially for video calls and live streaming. I also run a <a href=\"https://community.torproject.org/relay/\">Tor node</a> in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\">VM</a> which was being affected.</p>\n<p>After much troubleshooting, I was not able to fix it at the motherboard level, and my solution was to purchase a [USB to Ethernet adaptor](<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYTSN18,\">www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYT&hellip;</a> which I am happy to report, has remained online during my 3 days away to Lakes Entrance, returning home to a network that has remained online and functioning as expected!</p>\n<p>Apparently, Intel NIC&rsquo;s are known to have this issue? Have you come across it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"movies\">Movies</h2>\n<p>I watched two movies during the week that I briefly posted about. Those were <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/\">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/\">The Social Dilemma</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Bandersnatch was a great movie. It&rsquo;s very unique, like those <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/choose-your-own-ending\">novels that you can pick your characters ending</a> by choosing your path. Well, Bandersnatch does that in a movie form, where the path you pick throughout the movie, provides you with multiple different types of possible endings, dead-ends and just fun! I loved it, it felt very&hellip; schizophrenic? Don&rsquo;t do LSD kids, not without intention (and a good sitter)!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Social Dilemma on the other hand, was an eye-opener. I mean, I have already made a lot of changes in my life to move away from Social Media and more into my own identity on the web by following <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> principals. As well as completely <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/how-to-de-google\">DeGoogling</a> my life - especially on my phone! My phone is practically a brick with the bare minimum apps to suit my <em>needs</em> and nothing more. But I have taken it further, by not just <em>DeGoogling</em>, but also DeApping. So no emails, no social media, no nothing. The phone does two things. Handle phone calls, and messaging (encrypted through my own self-hosted <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a> instance). Other than that, my phone is in airplane mode, connected to home WiFi. Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off, all tracking off and running on <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/\">GrapheneOS</a>.  Highly recommend watching this documentary - it will open your eyes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"car-maintenance\">Car Maintenance</h2>\n<p>I did a little car maintenance on my wife&rsquo;s vehicle. I&rsquo;m not very hands on and definitely not a mechanic, unlike my brother. But I changed some light globes for the headlights and number plates and got my hands dirty. It&rsquo;s an old Toyota Camry Altise - I think 2015 odd? She&rsquo;s getting old, but still very reliable.</p>\n<p>Actually need to arrange with my brother to do its shock absorbers, as they&rsquo;ve reached their end-of-life!</p>\n<h2 id=\"voting\">Voting</h2>\n<p>We had to vote in Victoria for state parliament and local government. I did something different this year, as usually I just vote based on what I know personally, and that&rsquo;s nothing&hellip; as I really am not interested in any politics. But that is the wrong way to vote, and I fear a lot of us vote like I did.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-used-ai\">I used AI</h4>\n<p>Yes, you read right. I used AI to help me in making my informed decision. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean that I typed into the prompt, <em>&ldquo;Who do you recommend I vote for?</em>&rdquo; - that would be outright stupid.</p>\n<p>But I used AI as a tool to help me make my informed decision, and it performed very well.</p>\n<p>Basically, first I got AI to help me setup a score matrix spreadsheet. Where I listed topics that were important to me, not important to me and topics I was against. Each with their own score based on importance to me.</p>\n<p>For me, digital privacy, encryption, security, open source solutions and so forth are my top priorities. Among many others of course which I wont discuss here publicly. But AI was able to work a uniquely tailored scoring system for me.</p>\n<p>So then, there were 16 parties for me to rank based on my scoring. And AI helped here by writing me, essentially, an essay on each party and their representatives, one by one and scoring with me, giving each party a <strong>total</strong>.</p>\n<p>I made sure to look out for any controversial topics. Scoured the web for sources on anything that would raise red flags for me to lower my preferences for a certain person or party.</p>\n<p>In the end, I had 16 parties in order of preference that I was able to make informed decisions about to cast my vote.</p>\n<p>I would not recommend AI to give you its own opinions about people or parties. Remember that AI is an LLM and gathers its information from the WWW and will base its <em>opinions</em> on others opinions and not your own. Also, remember that opinions can be coded in by those who control the software.</p>\n<p>What you need, are sources you can read, watch and listen to.</p>\n<p>The process I used took a full day for me with everything else on hold. It was worth it, and I felt better using this method than my old method.</p>\n<p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a funny video I recommend you watch, just for a laugh:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Funny right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"lakes-entrance\">Lakes Entrance</h2>\n<p>Over the #AnzacDay long weekend, I took the family out to #LakesEntrance which is a 4 hour drive from #Melbourne and with my Tesla, requires at least one charge on route. This is good though, as it means I take a rest at least every 2 hours and stretch the legs.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing about electric vehicles, in my opinion, is that when you do need to charge on a long road trip, you get to leave the car plugged in and all get out of the car to go for a walk, go for a bite to eat in the local town and enjoy the scenery before continuing. I think this in itself will help with the road toll of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We started our trip with a visit of the <a href=\"https://raymondisland.net/\">Raymond Island</a>, which included a trip on the Raymond Island Ferry. The island has hundreds of koalas that you can see while going on walks around. There are some trails marked out on <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/south-raymond-island-foreshore-walk\">AllTrails</a> you can check out if you like, but you can basically walk anywhere along the Island and you are sure to find koalas all over the place. They were introduced back in 1953 to Raymond Island, from Phillip Island due to the population of Koalas in Australia almost becoming extinct due to not only disasters, but to the fur trade (we humans&hellip;).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We then went for a dinner at a place called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CathysAsianKitchen/\"><strong>Cathy&rsquo;s Asian Kitchen</strong></a> in Lakes Entrance. Hidden inside a motel carpark, we found it to be a hidden gem, with authentic and extra-tasty Malaysian Cuisine. Kudo&rsquo;s to the family owners on this one, as we absolutely loved it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The next location was the <a href=\"https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/buchan-caves-reserve\">Buchan Caves</a> in Buchan, Victoria. We went into the Fairy Cave and the Royal Cave and those were absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend you go pay those a visit and enjoy the day out there with the family, as there&rsquo;s also a multitude of walking trails to do. You can camp there, bring a caravan (with bookings) and all.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a video that I managed to record inside the Royal Cave in Buchan. It is essentially a walk-through from the end back to the exit on the way back out, as I was the last in my group with no one behind me to make me have to walk quicker.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>After the caves, we went for a 2 hour cruise on the waters using <a href=\"https://www.coastalstays.com/peelscruises/\">Peel&rsquo;s Lake Cruises</a>. There are other companies around that offer cruises, and I am sure they are just as good. However we picked this one last minute after lunch and after the caves and this cruise had some spots left for us.</p>\n<p>We got to see Fraser Island, Flannagans Island, Rigby&rsquo;s Island, Raymond Island and the beautiful surrounds of the local areas as a whole.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but the Captain took us to the entry of Lakes Entrance, known as &ldquo;The Entrance&rdquo; where seals are commonly seen sun bathing on the rocks. And that didn&rsquo;t disappoint, as the seals were indeed there having a wonderful time. Here&rsquo;s a video!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>On our final day we went to the <a href=\"https://www.metunghotsprings.com/\">Metung Hot Springs</a>. Our kids had never gone to any hot springs before, so this was an experience for them.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not as big as some of the other hot springs around Victoria, but given that it was not too busy when we went, there&rsquo;s was plenty for us to enjoy. I love the barrels up top with a view of the scenery below!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We could have ended our trip there, considering the 4 hour drive back home, but the kids really wanted to see the beach. So we completed a walk around some of the 90 mile beach. The trail was called the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lakes-entrance-loop-via-90-mile-beach\">Lakes Entrance Loop via 90 Mile Beach</a>. This was a beautiful walk with the family - and most important of all, the kids loved it. We got to see the seals again by <em>The Entrance</em> and loads of crabs! Check out these two small videos below:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All in all, a productive week indeed.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to fully stress test the system with heavy CPU workload, but this is nice, and it really compliments the whole look.\n#### Ethernet Issues Gone\nI'm also happy to report that my [Ethernet issues](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/24/so-lately-i-have-been.html) I had been having for a few months now are gone. I couldn't figure it out. I thought it was my [Linux distribution](https://system76.com/pop/) causing issues at the kernel level with my Ethernet going to sleep or being managed by the system somehow. \n\nBasically, randomly, my network would die on the PC, and the only way to get it back, was to physically unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it back in. Not even turning Ethernet on and off seemed to work. And it was happening at random times, not just when walking away from the PC; I could be in the middle of working and the network would go offline. \n\nThis was an issue, as I need a stable connection for my daily needs. Especially for video calls and live streaming. I also run a [Tor node](https://community.torproject.org/relay/) in a [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which was being affected.\n\nAfter much troubleshooting, I was not able to fix it at the motherboard level, and my solution was to purchase a [USB to Ethernet adaptor]([www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYT...](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYTSN18,) which I am happy to report, has remained online during my 3 days away to Lakes Entrance, returning home to a network that has remained online and functioning as expected!\n\nApparently, Intel NIC's are known to have this issue? Have you come across it?\n\n## Movies\nI watched two movies during the week that I briefly posted about. Those were [Black Mirror: Bandersnatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/) and [The Social Dilemma](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/).\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/mv5bmjm5mzgzmjm3of5bml5banbnxkftztgwmzq2mzqwnzm.-v1-.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork for the Netflix Original, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\" title=\"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\">\n\t<figcaption>Artwork for the Netflix Original, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBandersnatch was a great movie. It's very unique, like those [novels that you can pick your characters ending](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/choose-your-own-ending) by choosing your path. Well, Bandersnatch does that in a movie form, where the path you pick throughout the movie, provides you with multiple different types of possible endings, dead-ends and just fun! I loved it, it felt very... schizophrenic? Don't do LSD kids, not without intention (and a good sitter)!\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/aaaabbzitvp9iwps-lz6n9tf6bgllt49qsgdrijqip-vlor0ocihij2caq0guqps5acmekylhmb.jpeg\" alt=\"Artwork for The Social Dilemma documentary\" title=\"The Social Dilemma\">\n\t<figcaption>Artwork for The Social Dilemma documentary.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe Social Dilemma on the other hand, was an eye-opener. I mean, I have already made a lot of changes in my life to move away from Social Media and more into my own identity on the web by following [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) principals. As well as completely [DeGoogling](https://proton.me/blog/how-to-de-google) my life - especially on my phone! My phone is practically a brick with the bare minimum apps to suit my *needs* and nothing more. But I have taken it further, by not just *DeGoogling*, but also DeApping. So no emails, no social media, no nothing. The phone does two things. Handle phone calls, and messaging (encrypted through my own self-hosted [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) instance). Other than that, my phone is in airplane mode, connected to home WiFi. Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off, all tracking off and running on [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).  Highly recommend watching this documentary - it will open your eyes.\n## Car Maintenance\nI did a little car maintenance on my wife's vehicle. I'm not very hands on and definitely not a mechanic, unlike my brother. But I changed some light globes for the headlights and number plates and got my hands dirty. It's an old Toyota Camry Altise - I think 2015 odd? She's getting old, but still very reliable. \n\nActually need to arrange with my brother to do its shock absorbers, as they've reached their end-of-life!\n\n## Voting\nWe had to vote in Victoria for state parliament and local government. I did something different this year, as usually I just vote based on what I know personally, and that's nothing... as I really am not interested in any politics. But that is the wrong way to vote, and I fear a lot of us vote like I did.\n\n#### I used AI\nYes, you read right. I used AI to help me in making my informed decision. And no, I don't mean that I typed into the prompt, *\"Who do you recommend I vote for?*\" - that would be outright stupid.\n\nBut I used AI as a tool to help me make my informed decision, and it performed very well.\n\nBasically, first I got AI to help me setup a score matrix spreadsheet. Where I listed topics that were important to me, not important to me and topics I was against. Each with their own score based on importance to me.\n\nFor me, digital privacy, encryption, security, open source solutions and so forth are my top priorities. Among many others of course which I wont discuss here publicly. But AI was able to work a uniquely tailored scoring system for me.\n\nSo then, there were 16 parties for me to rank based on my scoring. And AI helped here by writing me, essentially, an essay on each party and their representatives, one by one and scoring with me, giving each party a **total**. \n\nI made sure to look out for any controversial topics. Scoured the web for sources on anything that would raise red flags for me to lower my preferences for a certain person or party.\n\nIn the end, I had 16 parties in order of preference that I was able to make informed decisions about to cast my vote. \n\nI would not recommend AI to give you its own opinions about people or parties. Remember that AI is an LLM and gathers its information from the WWW and will base its *opinions* on others opinions and not your own. Also, remember that opinions can be coded in by those who control the software. \n\nWhat you need, are sources you can read, watch and listen to.\n\nThe process I used took a full day for me with everything else on hold. It was worth it, and I felt better using this method than my old method. \n\nOh, and here's a funny video I recommend you watch, just for a laugh:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtVJ4JDM7eM?si=omESCjyqmWZkZyv_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFunny right?\n## Lakes Entrance\nOver the #AnzacDay long weekend, I took the family out to #LakesEntrance which is a 4 hour drive from #Melbourne and with my Tesla, requires at least one charge on route. This is good though, as it means I take a rest at least every 2 hours and stretch the legs. \n\nThe beautiful thing about electric vehicles, in my opinion, is that when you do need to charge on a long road trip, you get to leave the car plugged in and all get out of the car to go for a walk, go for a bite to eat in the local town and enjoy the scenery before continuing. I think this in itself will help with the road toll of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/raymond-island-aerial-view-r-147800-1600x1200.jpeg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the Raymond Island in Gippsland, Victoria\" title=\"Raymond Island\">\n\t<figcaption>Aerial photograph of Raymond Island, courtesy of [visitmelbourne.com](https://visitmelbourne.com)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe started our trip with a visit of the [Raymond Island](https://raymondisland.net/), which included a trip on the Raymond Island Ferry. The island has hundreds of koalas that you can see while going on walks around. There are some trails marked out on [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/south-raymond-island-foreshore-walk) you can check out if you like, but you can basically walk anywhere along the Island and you are sure to find koalas all over the place. They were introduced back in 1953 to Raymond Island, from Phillip Island due to the population of Koalas in Australia almost becoming extinct due to not only disasters, but to the fur trade (we humans...).\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250425-132907.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of a sleeping koala in a tree.\" title=\"Koala - Raymond Island\">\n\t<figcaption>A beautiful Koala having a drug induced sleep on a tree.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe then went for a dinner at a place called [**Cathy's Asian Kitchen**](https://www.facebook.com/CathysAsianKitchen/) in Lakes Entrance. Hidden inside a motel carpark, we found it to be a hidden gem, with authentic and extra-tasty Malaysian Cuisine. Kudo's to the family owners on this one, as we absolutely loved it.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250426-114334.jpg\" alt=\"Inside a limestone cave, with numerous thin stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites rising from the floor. The cave features reflective pools and smooth, wavy flowstone deposits along the ground and walls, all illuminated by soft lighting.\" title=\"Buchan Caves\">\n\t<figcaption>Stalagmites and Stalagtites inside the Royal Cave in Buchan, along with pool of calcium filled water and flowstone on the edges.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe next location was the [Buchan Caves](https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/buchan-caves-reserve) in Buchan, Victoria. We went into the Fairy Cave and the Royal Cave and those were absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend you go pay those a visit and enjoy the day out there with the family, as there's also a multitude of walking trails to do. You can camp there, bring a caravan (with bookings) and all. \n\nHere's a video that I managed to record inside the Royal Cave in Buchan. It is essentially a walk-through from the end back to the exit on the way back out, as I was the last in my group with no one behind me to make me have to walk quicker.\n\n<iframe title=\"Buchan Caves - Gippsland Victoria\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/tqbCxtwYfMmPBQSW8i8n5e\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe>\n\nAfter the caves, we went for a 2 hour cruise on the waters using [Peel's Lake Cruises](https://www.coastalstays.com/peelscruises/). There are other companies around that offer cruises, and I am sure they are just as good. However we picked this one last minute after lunch and after the caves and this cruise had some spots left for us.\n\nWe got to see Fraser Island, Flannagans Island, Rigby's Island, Raymond Island and the beautiful surrounds of the local areas as a whole.\n\nNot only that, but the Captain took us to the entry of Lakes Entrance, known as \"The Entrance\" where seals are commonly seen sun bathing on the rocks. And that didn't disappoint, as the seals were indeed there having a wonderful time. Here's a video!\n\n<iframe title=\"Seals - Peel's Cruise\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/sewyFpUFgNZ3kEP7n5Cbsr\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe>\n\nOn our final day we went to the [Metung Hot Springs](https://www.metunghotsprings.com/). Our kids had never gone to any hot springs before, so this was an experience for them. \n\nIt's not as big as some of the other hot springs around Victoria, but given that it was not too busy when we went, there's was plenty for us to enjoy. I love the barrels up top with a view of the scenery below!\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/metung-hot-springs-girls-in-bathing-barrels-on-hilltop-escarpment.jpeg\" alt=\"Three people are relaxing in wooden hot tubs on a deck overlooking a body of water. These hot tubs are part of the Metung Hot springs and are naturally heated. The sulphur gasses cause random bubbles like a mini spa bath at times.\" title=\"Metung Hot Springs Barrels\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo of the Metung Hot Springs barrels which are naturally heated and bubble at times by the naturally releasing Sulphuric Gasses.

So we completed a walk around some of the 90 mile beach. The trail was called the [Lakes Entrance Loop via 90 Mile Beach](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lakes-entrance-loop-via-90-mile-beach). This was a beautiful walk with the family - and most important of all, the kids loved it. We got to see the seals again by *The Entrance* and loads of crabs! Check out these two small videos below:\n\n<iframe title=\"Seals Playing Around\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/j8RrG4HNGUj6P4DrFgkxX2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe title=\"Crabs at Lakes Entrance\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/3wEJGedJvhzxqPjYppxb1W\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe>\n\n## Conclusion\nAll in all, a productive week indeed.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Looking at the whole week, I can already see that my routine was really put out of whack due to #NightShift. I don&rsquo;t know if I am just making excuses up, but it really does feel that way. I was not able to get my sleep pattern right, mostly breaking my 6 to 8 hour sleep period into two cycles. One perhaps within an hour of getting home from work, trying to sleep for 3 to 4 hours, and then waking up for a couple of hours and getting another 2 to 3 hours at the end of the day prior to heading off to work.</p>\n<p>During my period of time awake, I really did not feel like doing my daily 30 minutes of skipping, reading, or meditating. I really should have pushed more.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say now, at the end of the week and looking back at the daily journal entries - it was a daily mental push to give myself excuses to do other things with my time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-do-for-work\">What I do for work</h2>\n<p>Not sure I would call it work, as I actually do love my job. I&rsquo;m not sure the English language has any appropriate words for it? If you can help me out here, let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>The only reason I am delving more into this area of my life is because I happened to have discussions with someone in comments of my #thoughts posts on the #fediverse and answering a few questions throughout.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;m a police officer where I live, and I really enjoy helping people out when they need it most. I know a lot of us get jaded, joining a dream job only to find the reality of it is not what you think - but it really does take a certain mentality to look at the profession from different angles and to shift your focus from <em>crime centric</em> to <em>victim centric</em> and focusing on helping out the victim, communicating with the victim throughout the whole process.</p>\n<p>We are trained when going to a job to focus on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender. A lot of us get stuck in tunnel vision and want the fun stuff, chasing the offender and missing all the initial actions necessary for an investigation to be successful at court. And even more so, a lot of us forget in all of that, about the victim. Focusing only on the desired outcome with the offender.</p>\n<p>In the end, that leads to burnout. As this job has tonnes of paperwork involved (at least in Victoria). Focusing on the outcome of the offender only to get a result at court that is essentially a slap on the wrist brings you down - and then, because you never focused on the victim - the victim is wondering what&rsquo;s happened since police arrived - did police do nothing? You as a member now have no rapport with the victim.</p>\n<p>If you keep yourself focused on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender, not just at the initial job, but throughout the whole process, you are more likely to enjoy the full process, as is the victim going to understand the process by being spoken to like a human being, remembered and guided throughout. While the outcome at court may be the same result - your mind has been on helping a member of the community understand the process and know the likely outcome. This leads to a member of the community who understands the process we go through, understands the law system a little more, and is more likely to speak up to MP&rsquo;s or within the community about our law system to make desired changes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is one method I have come to enjoy my line of work in the mountain of paperwork and lack of time to do it.</p>\n<p>Another method I have come to keep enjoying it, is #compartmentalising and using my daily journal keeping, and my blogging on my own domain name.

In Australia (at least in Victoria), we don&rsquo;t have predatorial animals that are interested in humans, so the most common dangers are going to do with the lack of visibility, and these include your poor visibility, which increases your risk of getting lost and increases your risk of having trips and falls.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It’s also easier to get lost when you’re hiking at night.

That meant, if we were going to enjoy a more comfortable hike, we would have to do it under the cover of the early morning sky.</p>\n<p>Initially, we wanted to wake up at 5:00 AM and I predicted we would be leaving home by 6:00 AM and arriving to the site by the crack of dawn at 7:00 AM. Fortunately though, we actually ended up getting to the site at 6:00 AM, and it was still pitch black by the time we got there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-experience\">The Experience</h2>\n<p>So there I was, standing in the middle of the darkness with my wife at <a href=\"https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/werribee-gorge-state-park\">Werribee Gorge</a>, about to do the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/werribee-gorge-via-shelter-shed-and-short-circuit-track\">Long and Short Circuit Track combined</a>.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I am always prepared when I go hiking. I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>My torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark.</p>\n<p>While I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.</p>\n<p>The torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you&rsquo;d like to check out the torch, it&rsquo;s a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on <a href=\"https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam.</p>\n<p>I also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet!<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there&rsquo;s plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"strange-sounds\">Strange Sounds</h3>\n<p>While commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that&rsquo;s how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.</p>\n<p>I was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don&rsquo;t know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"and-then-came-the-next-challenge\">And then came the next challenge.</h3>\n<p>You see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below.</p>\n<p>Putting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"serene-views--wildlife\">Serene Views &amp; Wildlife</h3>\n<p>On the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.</p>\n<p>As the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>One of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a <a href=\"https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system\">filtration system</a>, of course), and you&rsquo;re actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it&rsquo;s a much sought after resource!</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It&rsquo;s got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn&rsquo;t too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!</p>\n<p>We finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Would I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?</p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let&rsquo;s see if we can tackle the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge\">Lerderderg Gorge</a> and I will let you all know how that goes!</p>\n<p>And then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.</p>\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below.\nWhat&rsquo;s your experience hiking in the darkness?

I always pack my essentials in my trusty kit, and this includes a good quality torch.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/shadowhawk-torch.jpg\" alt=\"A black flashlight with a strap is resting on a dark textured surface.\" title=\"Shadowhawk Torch\">\n\t<figcaption>A good and powerful torch is always recommended.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMy torch was obviously my first go to. And we had to decide if we would try the hike up the mountain with our night vision adjusted eyes, or use the torch. There are pros and benefits to either method, however on this occasion, the moon was not up in the sky, and there was a little cloud cover which made it extra dark. \n\nWhile I probably would have enjoyed the benefits that come with not using any light source, such as a better field of view and a sense of larger surroundings, the consequences of tripping due to the low light available, and being with my wife as someone else to take care of, meant that we chose to use the light source.\n\nThe torch I have was powerful, and it was good to see that after a couple months of storage and no use in my kit that it still had a good 99% of battery available. If you'd like to check out the torch, it's a Shadowhawk Tactical Flashlight and is available on [Amazon](https://amzn.asia/d/hUJKRQJ). \n\nI'm not sure how accurate the claims are to lumens, but I know from my personal experience with it that it was more than ample for my needs with hiking. Having the ability to have a large arc of light, all the way to a nice and slim, concentrated beam. \n\nI also cannot comment on the safety of the included rechargeable lithium battery, but it has not exploded in my bag as yet![^3]\n\nAnother thing I can comment on though is the life of the battery. I used it for a full hour straight prior to daylight hitting the summit of our hike, and the battery dropped 7% - so there's plenty of juice to last you the night, and if you bring a good battery pack with you as part of your kit, you wont have issues.\n\n### Strange Sounds\n\nWhile commencing our hike, the first thing I noticed was the serenity of the night. You know how when you wake up during the night and the sounds seem amplified? Everything is much louder that you could pretty much hear a pin drop? Well that's how it felt out there in the darkness, and you could hear every little rustle in the trees and shrub. All the sounds are much more prominent, which, if I were by myself for my first experience in the darkness in a forest, I would have been pretty frightened. I highly recommend bringing some company for your first attempt.\n\nI was frightened enough when I first got into hiking and would go on trails by myself during the day. Hearing new sounds and figuring out what they were kept me hyper-vigilant. Multiply that by I don't know how much in the darkness, but multiply it nonetheless. \n\n### And then came the next challenge.\n\nYou see, I enjoy hiking using trekking poles. Especially when I have a heavy kit on my back. And holding a torch in one hand, kind of removes the ability to be able to use my poles effectively. \n\nI'll need to invest on a headlamp I think, which includes red light to keep my night vision from being affected as much. If anyone has any suggestions for one that works well for them, and has good battery life (and preferably can be recharged via USB), I would love to read your recommendations in the discussions below. \n\nPutting that little difficulty aside, I did manage to make the summit, and by the time we reached the top, daylight was peaking through the sky and I was able to pack the torch away.\n\n### Serene Views & Wildlife\n\nOn the way down the other side, we stopped for a break to view the river flowing through the gorge below. It was astonishing. The sun barely creeping over the horizon and starting to peak over the mountain to one side and shining over to the next as the river flow made beautiful relaxing sounds. I did not get to make a sound recording of it on this occasion, but I will be sure to do so on my next one and share it with you.\n\nAs the light kept coming through, when we did spot wildlife, it was easier to take video. One of the fascinating animals we got to see was a Wallaby, and I managed to record a video of it as it watched us in as much curiosity as we had for it.\n\n<center><iframe title=\"Wallaby\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/72efb40c-ab67-41e3-9520-a5ad05548473\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe></center>\n\nOne of the best things about hiking places like Werribee Gorge is being close to a river. The sounds are relaxing as the water hits the rocks beneath. You always have a source of water should you need it (with a [filtration system](https://www.sawyer.com/product/squeeze-water-filter-system), of course), and you're actually more likely to see wildlife during certain periods of the day, as it's a much sought after resource!\n\nThere's also a really cool portion of the walk on this trail which has you clinging onto the side of a rock-face with water beneath you. It's got cable around it ready for you to hold onto which makes it that much more fun to experience.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/9609872753-b73286a802-b.jpg\" alt=\"A rocky cliffside with a rope trail runs alongside a calm river with dry trees and greenery in the background.\" title=\"Werribee Gorge Cable Run\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo Source: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/\">cafuego</a> - <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/9609872753\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/cafuego/9609872753</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe managed to make it around the mountain prior to the sun getting too high up, which meant the UV wasn't too strong yet and we could finish our walk around the Eastern side of the mountain, known as the Short Circuit Walk, which sees you doing a few more steep sections prior to making your way back down where we parked our car. This section of the walk was challenging enough to get the heart rate going and the sweats on prior to melting in the days heat!\n\nWe finished the hike around 10:00 AM and made it back to the air conditions vehicle for the drive back home.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWould I recommend night hiking, and would I do it again?\n\nYes, absolutely. I plan on doing it again this weekend if the opportunity arises, again with my wife. Let's see if we can tackle the [Lerderderg Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge) and I will let you all know how that goes!\n\nAnd then I plan on doing some of these even later during the night, perhaps straight after work or something and tackling them on my lonesome for some ample time to record natures sounds and take some amazing photographs.\n\nI hope that you enjoyed reading this article and would love to hear from you below. \nWhat's your experience hiking in the darkness? Have you done it before? Would you do it again? If you haven't done it before, would you consider giving it a go?\n\n---\nFootnotes:\n[^1]: https://unlockoutdoors.com/benefits-of-night-hiking/\n[^2]: https://flyfreshflight.com/is-hiking-at-night-dangerous/\n[^3]: https://budgetlightforum.com/t/lithium-ion-battery-safety-101/38554\n\n",

Need to make sure to eat the right foods that can provide energy throughout the day, not just simple sugars that give you an hour boost, then all of a sudden, nothing.</p>  <p>I done some major core workouts 2 nights ago with my friend Dean. Over 120 push-ups &amp; 120 sit-ups.</p>  <p>Now I am sitting at home a little bored &amp; wondering what to do whilst waiting on some washing to complete. It’s a little too hot &amp; stuffy to clean the bathroom.</p>  <p>Tonight at 5pm I will be doing some light sparring – that will be fun. And tomorrow, more training and light sparring with Dean.</p>  <p>On other details, I am booking a night out at a vineyard in the Macedon Mountains for Dao &amp; I which should be both relaxing &amp; fun. We have never had the opportunity to have time completely alone with each other since we met more than a year ago now.    <br>We will be out in the country, enjoying the fresh air, a 3 course dinner &amp; breakfast in the morning.</p>  <p>Also I look forward to our time together in Vietnam. Instead of just being with Dao’s family, we will also be spending some time alone at a tourist resort by the finely sanded beach. This will be a whole lot of fun &amp; romantic.</p>  <p>Anyway, I need to look carefully into setting myself up a diet, which will enable me to store plenty of energy to burn throughout the day. Perhaps even gain me another 5kg or so.   <br>I wouldn’t mind hitting 75kg for my height and build.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "Week 1 – Not as Planned",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My first week of intense training did not go to plan for myself. Point is, I should have known to do more stretching before and after training. I did none - literally. </p>  <p>Now, the thing with this is. When you begin to push your muscles and work on ones that you’ve never really pushed before, if you don’t do stretching, you will feel the ache for days on end after each time your exercise.   <br>So, instead of getting a good full week of training, I got almost 2 days. I couldn’t finish my run on the treadmill as I had planned because of my calves and my right ankle. The ankle has been bad for a couple of weeks since beginning on the jump rope, but I bought some ankle guards to help with that. But on my first day of harder training I went for 3 by 3 minute rounds of skipping with 30 second breaks, on top of treadmill, weights, sparring and cardio; totalling 3 hours in the night. My muscles needed stretching, which I did not do. This put me off training for the rest of the week; argh!</p>  <p>I have 2 weeks off work now; holiday pay. So I’m happy about that. I can focus my mind, relax and concentrate on training properly. It’ll also give me time to relax my mind. Instead of work, train, work, train. I can produce a schedule to ease the mind. I found that with harder training and constantly thinking about fighting, you begin to lose the balance in your mind… something they call Yin Yang?  I felt a build up of testosterone for a while and more eager to get into a fight; more confident, but also to a point I felt I could be more cocky towards peoples attitude. This is something that is a big no for me, and requires that I focus, give myself time to sit down, close my eyes and bring my mind back to Earth. This was not during my first week; this had been building up over my previous 5 months.</p>  <p>Let’s hope next week will prove to be more of a success!</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "The Making of a Fighter",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A new Chapter in my life is being made as I write this blog post. And that is ‘<strong>The Making of a Fighter</strong>’.</p>  <p>Those of you who have been keeping up with my blog, know that I have been doing Muay Thai as a sport and as a way to keep myself fit. But I am taking it to the next level, now that the opportunity has been given. I wish to become a Fighter, and get myself on the ring over time with hard training.</p>  <p>I’ve been asking around, and a lot of fighters work full time on top of their training. So really, whether or not you can become a fighter has a lot to do with the right mentality and strength in your mind to motivate yourself to work your 10 hour days and then go straight off to training for a few more hours after that before finally getting home to relax. </p>  <p>I believe I have the mentality and the strength to push myself to train hard and make something of myself. Energy and explosive energy are very much in the mind; I’ve proven that to myself various times. Of course, the right foods also play a very large role in this. it is much like weight training. The three biggest ingredients in life to get where you want always remain: <strong>DIET, TRAINING, SLEEP</strong>. By diet I do not mean a ‘lose weight’ diet. I mean eating the right foods that focus on where you want to go. High carbs to gain weight (of course, high carbs being complex carbs with less chance of storing as ‘fat’), proteins to feed your muscles before and after training and so on.</p>  <p>So, I will start the heavy routine on Monday. Working from 5am till 3-4pm. Doing fight training from 5-6pm. Stopping to feed the body with more energy and doing weight training from 6-7pm. Doing the intermediate training and cardio from 7-8pm and finishing up with some floor work with Karl to do some Jujitsu training or sparring. Hopefully home and in bed by 10pm and ready for the next day of work and stuffing the body full of good foods and energy.</p>  <p>John Scida tells me he can make good fighters (and I’ve seen it). But, I doubt we can make good fighters who haven’t the mentality and strength to push themselves to the limit? You need the right person, the right stock. From my reading on Melbourne’s underworld, I’ve noticed that most if not all of the main figures involved, were fighters in their past; either Muay Thai, Kick Boxing, Boxing and so forth. Why? Is it because that these Men were strong minded? And why were they the way they were? St. Albans and Sunshine is considered a brewing location for fighters. Because they learn to fend for themselves on the street? But it’s also considered a brewing location for the criminals? And why is it that criminals are the ones with the strong mindset to train and become fighters?</p>  <p>Is there a balance between fight training and relaxing the mind and body?</p>  <p>And for great trainers like John Scida. Does it not become disappointing to lose potentially great fighters who’ve trained so hard and well only to be lost to the law system or to be found ten feet under?</p>  <p>I wish to become 1 out of 200 students. I will become 1 out of 200 students. I will work, I will train, I will relax and rest. And I will stay on my side of the fence. That of a life of honour, respect, loyalty. </p>  <p>The new Chapter begins.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Within 15 minutes I arrive and we’re off to bargain on a good laptop. </p>  <p>I spent 4 hours with them setting everything up, the toughest part being the router due to having to get the internet access passwords back and such and making sure it’s well secured from outside users trying to access the wireless options. They have 3 laptops and a PC accessing the router.</p>  <p>8am the next morning I am awakened by a phone call asking if I am home. A bran new lawn mower is awaiting me at my door within the next half hour as a thank you gift for my service to the family. </p>  <p>I guess that will stop me spending money on Jim’s Mowing (check my old posts!) every few weeks to get my lawn done.

By the looks of the thing, it was entering me about 2mm at a time, in and out, really fast. Just imagine the tip of a needle just sitting on your skin and dragging it along your arm slowly and that’s probably as close as you will get to the feeling. I will say that the pain is <em>sudden on</em>  as much as it is <em>sudden off</em>. As soon as the needle hits your skin and gets dragged you feel the slight pain, and as soon as it comes off your skin you are all relaxed again and forget that it was even there. Of course, there are certain spots along the arm with different pain thresholds, such as where you arm bends, opposite your elbow; it’s very fleshy there and probably the only place besides the triceps area where you might grit your teeth or look away a little!</p>  <p>Personally, I think the most painful part for me was actually getting home an hour later having to run the whole thing under warm soapy water. I jumped in the shower. I think it hurt more than the needle in the way that it activates the pain all over the art work, not just in the one spot the needle is entering. It reddens your arm and makes it feel like you just got a massive sunburn and that pain has still stuck with me over night. But nothing that can’t be lived with for the next few days.</p>  <p>Of course, let’s not forget the preparation before the tattoo. They shaved my arm completely clean; not that I had any hairs there to start with! And then they rub your whole arm in dettol and alcohol. As long as you know how to control your mind and forget pain is there, you’ll be fine. They had to rub my arm clean over 4 times to get the stencil right, so my arm was pretty bright red before even starting the ink work.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERp3OjJ6I/AAAAAAAAAEU/TRKsQ5_CztY/s1600-h/P7180067%5B16%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180067\" height=\"233\" alt=\"P7180067\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/25ef83d073.jpg\" width=\"285\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a> So, what exactly is my tattoo about? Well, I wanted to draw a sword on my right arm. Since in today's day and age in our society, we are not permitted to carry a sword; you’ll find yourself arrested. So, how can I carry a sword that means something to me and my past? Ink it! So, I get a sword designed, and I love a beast called a Tarn in a fantasy series I read, which resembles in our world, an Eagle. Except that they are so large that a human can ride on its back and battle it out in the skies. The handle of my sword is designed with two eagle heads facing away from each other. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERsVF8bII/AAAAAAAAAEc/3XasepCATbc/s1600-h/P7180066%5B7%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180066\" height=\"285\" alt=\"P7180066\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/ea4f4edba1.jpg\" width=\"233\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> Then, I wanted vines and scrolls wrapping the whole sword, so that I could show the meaning of it out to everyone. I put my name on the top, symbolising that it is my sword, and then I put my direct family names down the whole blade. My grandparents on both sides of my family, my mother, father, sister, brother. Should my sword be used (my arm or fist in reality) you will feel the wrath of my whole family. My sword is my honour, it is my life. </p>  <p>Are tattoo’s addictive as the rumour goes? Yes, completely! As much pain as you are going through, they are addictive. I’m already getting my left shoulder designed, which will be a shield; within it my family emblem displaying <em>Lison</em>. And I even have my back design in mind already, but more on that when I get my shield done to match my sword. Don’t want to spoil that post ability!</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Cheers everyone! </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

I’ve picked it up and have booked in to get it done on the 17th of July for the outlining and then on the 31st of July for the shading and what not. </p>  <p>I wonder how much it’ll hurt?</p>  <p>I’ve decided to put my name in the handle scroll and 8 family names from my brother, sister, parents and  grand parents down the blade of the sword which will symbolise my blood and inner power through to my hands/wrists. </p>  <p>It’ll be a 3/4 sleeve design all the way down my right arm. Once this is done I’m getting my family crest designed in tattoo form for my left arm in a shield, and possibly after that a large design on my back which is still sitting in my mind (warrior mounted on a large eagle swooping down with talons open to capture a naked woman in the open fields of grass).</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Because I don’t! I work 50 hour weeks and by the time I get home or the weekend comes around I’m just too buggered. All I want to do is relax and enjoy the weekend while I can; making the most of it. Much like I am doing now – sitting here relaxing on a Friday afternoon as a very nice bloke from Jim’s Mowing who’s still on business hours works on my front and back yard.</p>  <p>As you can see from the photo I took on the right, it look(ed) quite a mess. Since splitting up with my Ex-Girlfriend and her having still lived here for a while I refused to do all the dirty work; which I think is fair?</p>  <p>Ok, so if I did it in the first place, the grass wouldn’t have gotten this bad and I wouldn’t of had to call in Jim’s Mowing to do the work. But these guys do a good job, and they are good on the price.</p>  <p>My front lawn and back lawn cost a total of $70, including weeding. And if I use them on an ongoing basis it’ll cost $50. I know, I’m lazy and should buy a lawn mower. But for shared accommodation? I think it’s a good set up :)</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samlison/3575496574/\"><img title=\"IMG00021\" height=\"245\" alt=\"IMG00021\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/c4d006de93.jpg\" width=\"287\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a></p>  <p>Wouldn’t you agree? Now all that’s left to do is get my lazy but up and fix those bricks surrounding the trees :D</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

It seems that ever since using my sisters laptop (mind you I can’t wait to get my new one of my own so I can post a whole lot more funner subjects including videos) I’ve become more hooked onto social networking sites.</p>  <p>I’m now connected to Twitter, FaceBook, Blogger (this blog), Windows Live Spaces, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Gmail, Google Reader, Calender and more!</p>  <p>I’m planning on having my main website <a href=\"http://www.samuellison.com\">www.samuellison.com</a> designed by professionals linking to all of these services directly to me. And while I’m getting that done I’m thinking about getting a really nifty personal business card (what else do you call them even if they are not for business use? Contact Card? Social Card?) with personal graphics, logo, website address and mobile phone.     <br>I was thinking my site to be directed to me in online form; having a cartoon character created with me wearing what I do in my real workplace (all whites) but with a laptop and all these techie goodies; making him somewhat cool yet… meaty :P </p>  <p>I’ll get a quote on web design and graphics design. It’ll be one page only with perhaps a contact form to my gmail account or something. We’ll see what I can get done!</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-24829348645671267?l=samlison.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

There were not many innovative designs or new models; probably because last years models or before, for many of the companies, are still unsold and sitting around collecting dust? <p>Anyway, I took a few photos of the usual sports cars we see there, including my favourite lotus :P and only my favourite because lotus use  the exact same engine that is in my Toyota.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-5809036281476976125?l=samlison.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",
