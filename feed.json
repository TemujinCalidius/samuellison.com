				"title": "Weekly Recap - Week 21",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I feel like I had a pretty unproductive week. And I do my best to blame the fact that I was on #NightShift for the week at work, but really, as much as I can whine and carry on that I was a little tired, looking back, I could have pushed forward and at least ticked off my tasks instead of sit at the computer screen not really doing much.</p>\n<p>Disappointed in myself yet again this week. I need to find myself better methods to ensure that I complete what I had set out to do.\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m productive at work though, so that&rsquo;s not the issue. It&rsquo;s the procrastination when I get home after work prior to jumping into bed. I can do better.</p>\n<p>So, what DID I get up to with my time then?</p>\n<h2 id=\"method-for-breaking-sleep-routine\">Method for Breaking Sleep Routine</h2>\n<p>One thing that I and many others find hard about night shift, in particular with flexible shift work,  where shifts can go from mornings to afternoons and vice versa every week, and one whole week can be a night shift with the weeks after being back to mornings/afternoons again is the damage is does to your routine and way of life.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not at all the same as just <em>being on night shift</em> permanently, which that in itself has its own long-term effects on the human body. It&rsquo;s 7 nights with a recovery day, and back into flexible rostering after nights.</p>\n<p>Right now, due to resourcing issues, we are on minimum night shifts. Meaning, we do a night shift week, every 4th week.</p>\n<p>So how do I tackle getting into the first night of night shifts after being on different hours and regular sleeping routines?</p>\n<p>I use to just try and push the first night and not change anything - no extra sleep, just straight into night shift and try to stay awake on the first night.</p>\n<p>This didn&rsquo;t work. In actuality, it&rsquo;s dangerous in my line of work in emergency services. We need to be awake, we need to not be fatigued and we need to have the mental capacity to deal with highly stressful situations.</p>\n<p>Now, I will go out of my way, the night prior to my first night shift, to stay up as long as I can through the night. If that means #BingeWatching movies or playing games, and drinking lots of #coffee, then so be it. I will do my best to stay away until between 5 and 7am the next morning. If I need a quick nap after that, I will give myself a 1 to 2 hour teaser nap and keep pushing through, doing activities with the family if I can.</p>\n<p>I then aim to go to sleep around lunch time and get as much sleep as possible. Between 6 to 8 hours before waking up and getting ready for that first night shift.</p>\n<p>It worked wonders for me last week, and I started my first night feeling fully rejuvenated and ready for the action - and glad I did, because the first night was quite a busy one that required focus, attention to detail and the ability to react!</p>\n<p>In saying that, here in Australia it&rsquo;s currently the end of Autumn and hitting the edge of winter. So nights are longer and days are colder. So it&rsquo;s much easier to fall asleep rugged up, than it is sweating in the heat. I&rsquo;ll get back to you all if I manage to keep this method up during the warmer months!</p>\n<h2 id=\"beautiful-music--guitar-playing\">Beautiful Music &amp; Guitar Playing</h2>\n<p>My daughter has been learning to play the guitar and has taken a fancy for finger picking vs using a pick for her playing, and her new tutor is doing well as teaching her.</p>\n<p>With this, I went back to some old music I enjoy listening to and looked up Estas Tonne, to have my daughter listen to it and see what she thought.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s such beautiful music. Put on some headphones, close your eyes, listen, enjoy the story that unfolds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"change-of-milk\">Change of Milk</h2>\n<p>This week, I changed my milk supply. Exciting, right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/22/i-dont-know-why-i.html\">samuellison.com/2025/05/2&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t move to more expensive milk and organic milks until now. So much more creamy and tastier. Way more wholesome too.\n#WholeFoods</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know I know, so exciting it was worthy of making the weekly recap. That, or I am finding anything to add to this week due to my utter laziness procrastinating at home when I am nights!</p>\n<h2 id=\"camera-shopping\">Camera Shopping</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking exactly which camera I want to upgrade to for my photography, from the #NikonD7000 I am currently using.</p>\n<p>Originally, I was thinking about the Sony A6700 ASP-C camera, which is a great purchase. But, if I am going to invest so much into a camera, why not full frame in that case. Especially since my focus in photography is currently #Macro and in particular, #Fungi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/24/one-more-day-to-go.html\">samuellison.com/2025/05/2&hellip;</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One more day to go of #NightShift! Having a coffee now that I am home. So, other than that&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the #camera I wish to purchase.

				"content_text": "\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/108398-original-local-1200x1050-v3-converted.webp\">\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@sporetrail@mastodon.social\">\n\nI feel like I had a pretty unproductive week. And I do my best to blame the fact that I was on #NightShift for the week at work, but really, as much as I can whine and carry on that I was a little tired, looking back, I could have pushed forward and at least ticked off my tasks instead of sit at the computer screen not really doing much.\n\nDisappointed in myself yet again this week. I need to find myself better methods to ensure that I complete what I had set out to do.\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\nI'm productive at work though, so that's not the issue. It's the procrastination when I get home after work prior to jumping into bed. I can do better.\n\nSo, what DID I get up to with my time then?\n\n## Method for Breaking Sleep Routine\nOne thing that I and many others find hard about night shift, in particular with flexible shift work,  where shifts can go from mornings to afternoons and vice versa every week, and one whole week can be a night shift with the weeks after being back to mornings/afternoons again is the damage is does to your routine and way of life. \n\nIt's not at all the same as just *being on night shift* permanently, which that in itself has its own long-term effects on the human body. It's 7 nights with a recovery day, and back into flexible rostering after nights.\n\nRight now, due to resourcing issues, we are on minimum night shifts. Meaning, we do a night shift week, every 4th week.\n\nSo how do I tackle getting into the first night of night shifts after being on different hours and regular sleeping routines?\n\nI use to just try and push the first night and not change anything - no extra sleep, just straight into night shift and try to stay awake on the first night.\n\nThis didn't work. In actuality, it's dangerous in my line of work in emergency services. We need to be awake, we need to not be fatigued and we need to have the mental capacity to deal with highly stressful situations.\n\nNow, I will go out of my way, the night prior to my first night shift, to stay up as long as I can through the night. If that means #BingeWatching movies or playing games, and drinking lots of #coffee, then so be it. I will do my best to stay away until between 5 and 7am the next morning. If I need a quick nap after that, I will give myself a 1 to 2 hour teaser nap and keep pushing through, doing activities with the family if I can.\n\nI then aim to go to sleep around lunch time and get as much sleep as possible. Between 6 to 8 hours before waking up and getting ready for that first night shift.\n\nIt worked wonders for me last week, and I started my first night feeling fully rejuvenated and ready for the action - and glad I did, because the first night was quite a busy one that required focus, attention to detail and the ability to react!\n\nIn saying that, here in Australia it's currently the end of Autumn and hitting the edge of winter. So nights are longer and days are colder. So it's much easier to fall asleep rugged up, than it is sweating in the heat. I'll get back to you all if I manage to keep this method up during the warmer months!\n\n## Beautiful Music & Guitar Playing\nMy daughter has been learning to play the guitar and has taken a fancy for finger picking vs using a pick for her playing, and her new tutor is doing well as teaching her. \n\nWith this, I went back to some old music I enjoy listening to and looked up Estas Tonne, to have my daughter listen to it and see what she thought.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hn10okvX19E?si=6dZ02uMHmLPHciQ1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIt's such beautiful music. Put on some headphones, close your eyes, listen, enjoy the story that unfolds.\n\n## Change of Milk\nThis week, I changed my milk supply. Exciting, right?\n\n[samuellison.com/2025/05/2...](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/22/i-dont-know-why-i.html)\n\n> I don't know why I didn't move to more expensive milk and organic milks until now. So much more creamy and tastier. Way more wholesome too.\n> #WholeFoods\n\nI know I know, so exciting it was worthy of making the weekly recap. That, or I am finding anything to add to this week due to my utter laziness procrastinating at home when I am nights!\n\n## Camera Shopping\nI've been looking exactly which camera I want to upgrade to for my photography, from the #NikonD7000 I am currently using.\n\nOriginally, I was thinking about the Sony A6700 ASP-C camera, which is a great purchase. But, if I am going to invest so much into a camera, why not full frame in that case. Especially since my focus in photography is currently #Macro and in particular, #Fungi.\n\n[samuellison.com/2025/05/2...](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/24/one-more-day-to-go.html)\n> One more day to go of #NightShift! Having a coffee now that I am home. So, other than that... I've been thinking about the #camera I wish to purchase. And have decided to go with an #Sony #A7RV instead of the #A6700. $2k price difference, but I don't think I will regret it long-term.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/108398-original-local-1200x1050-v3-converted.webp\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Sony AR7V\">\n\t<figcaption>Sony A7RV</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI've decided I will go with the [Sony AR7V](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/full-frame/p/ilce7rm5-b). It will be much more forgiving for me, and due to the fact that I can do macro with 61 megapixels and, if I find I need to, I have plenty of detail to be able to crop in and still get pristine images. \n\nThis purchase would last me a very long time. And I feel much more comfortable investing in some good lenses for a camera I own, over purchasing lenses for the Nikon I am currently using, which is not mine.\n\n## More Tech (M.2 SSD Upgrade)\nI went ahead and purchased a new 2TB M.2 SSD to plug into my mothyerboard, which will replace the 512gb one I have currently. \n\nThis is so that when I do my photography and videos, I can drag all my raw and unedited content there for post-editing. This will allow me to do my photo editing in #DarkTable much fast than working with files over the network on the NAS. Same with video editing.\n\nWhile shopping for this SSD, I realised however, that bus speeds have progressed on motherboards and that my motherboard is now quite ancient. They have PCIe 5.0 now, which would upgrade my SSD speed from around 3,000MB/s to 14,000MB/s!\n\nThat's phenomenal. Unfortunately though, that means I need a motherboard upgrade that has PCIe M.2 slots. And that also means the CPU needs upgrading to the new socket types, as well as my memory going from DDR4 to DDR5. I can't use the same CPU and memory in modern motherboards.\n\nAnyway, I will keep my old 512gig M.2 SSD for when I do upgrade my motherboard in future. As I will be able to re-use that, I believe! And get myself one of those new fancy PCIe 5.0 versions for the editing drive.  That'll put me on 4 x M.2 drives by the time I am ready for the upgrade.\n\n## Conclusion\nAnother week gone for 2025. Almost half way. Amazing how quick a year can escape you before you realise it's gone. \n\nMake the most of it everyone!\n",

I mean, it&rsquo;s almost the end of spring now, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Daylesford\">Lake Daylesford</a> has never ceased to amaze me with its flourish of mushrooms. The beautiful red and white spotted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria\">Amanita Muscaria</a> are usually always there this time of year, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suillus\">Slippery Jacks</a>.</p>\n<p>This year however, it seems there was a bit of a drought. That, or the local council finally put an end to it and removed all the mushrooms to prevent people getting sick?</p>\n<p>I do think it&rsquo;s the weather, as I went up the road to a usual lookout for a waterfall, and there was no water flowing at all this year. This is concerning.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I took my mother to Lake Daylesford and we had a wonderful walk around the lake. I didn&rsquo;t manage to snap any high quality photos of mushrooms, and yes, I did find a <em>single</em> Amanita out there on its own, but I didn&rsquo;t manage to get a good photo using my camera. I did get a sneaky shot on my phone though.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250514-120251.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250514-120251.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A vibrant red mushroom, possibly an amanita, is growing on the forest floor surrounded by grass and trees.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Other than that photo though, I did manage to snap and edit some beautiful shots of the lake and surrounds.</p>\n<p>I am most proud of this one from the day. The colours really came out well post-edit and I like the composition. Looking at it now though, I could have centred the house perfectly and cropped out some of the leaves showing on the right of the image.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1653.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1653.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A house is nestled by a tranquil lakeside surrounded by vibrant fall foliage.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>In this photo of the bench, I thought it looked nice and told a little story in itself. The lonely bench with no one sitting on it currently, looking over the waters. I like how the plants up ahead in the lake just happened to align with the bench though. Again, I could have centred it better post-editing.\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1645.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1645.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A wooden bench is situated under leafy trees, overlooking a tranquil lake with vegetation on the opposite shore.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>I loved this overall shot of the lake. I didn&rsquo;t have a wide enough lens with me to really capture it all, but now thinking about it, I should have zoomed in more and captured the area to the left reaching over to the centre of the photo and captured more detail there, perhaps centering the largest tree there to the image. Maybe next time!\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1626.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1626.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A serene lake reflects a tree-lined shore and vibrant autumn foliage under a clear blue sky.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Actually, below is an edit of that photo just to see. Unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t currently have a powerful enough camera to crop in so much and I lose a lot of the detail. Still cannot wait to get my new camera! And looking at the photo again, I should show the full reflection of that tree in the water too! Live and learn!\n<a href=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/b562ccb216.jpg\" \n   class=\"glightbox\"\n   data-gallery=\"fb94e76b2dd58c40d28aee5f921c657b\"\n   \n>\n  <img src =\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/b562ccb216.jpg\" \n       loading=\"lazy\"\n       decoding=\"async\"\n       style=\"border-radius: 5px; max-width: 100%\"\n       alt=\"A tranquil lakeside scene features a red-roofed building and trees with vibrant foliage reflected in the water under a clear blue sky.\" \n        \n  />\n</a>\n\n</p>\n<p>Then I tried something new for me by taking a photo directly into the sun.

				"content_text": "<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1653.jpg\">\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@sporetrail@mastodon.social\">\nAgain, I started the week off strong with my task list, but, as seems to have been the pattern prior, for the rest of the week, I didn't tick off **ANY** of my tasks. I can't seem to break this cycle, and I really need to mentally try harder to get this part of my life under control and routine to meet the goals I wish.\n\nBut, I still had a fun week!\n<!--more-->\n<span id=\"more\"></span>\n\n## Lake Daylesford\nWith spring here, I anticipated that my usual haunt out at #LakeDaylesford here in Victoria would have plenty mushrooms. I mean, it's almost the end of spring now, and [Lake Daylesford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Daylesford) has never ceased to amaze me with its flourish of mushrooms. The beautiful red and white spotted [Amanita Muscaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria) are usually always there this time of year, along with [Slippery Jacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suillus). \n\nThis year however, it seems there was a bit of a drought. That, or the local council finally put an end to it and removed all the mushrooms to prevent people getting sick? \n\nI do think it's the weather, as I went up the road to a usual lookout for a waterfall, and there was no water flowing at all this year. This is concerning.\n\nAnyway, I took my mother to Lake Daylesford and we had a wonderful walk around the lake. I didn't manage to snap any high quality photos of mushrooms, and yes, I did find a *single* Amanita out there on its own, but I didn't manage to get a good photo using my camera. I did get a sneaky shot on my phone though.\n![A vibrant red mushroom, possibly an amanita, is growing on the forest floor surrounded by grass and trees.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250514-120251.jpg)\n\nOther than that photo though, I did manage to snap and edit some beautiful shots of the lake and surrounds. \n\nI am most proud of this one from the day. The colours really came out well post-edit and I like the composition. Looking at it now though, I could have centred the house perfectly and cropped out some of the leaves showing on the right of the image.\n![A house is nestled by a tranquil lakeside surrounded by vibrant fall foliage.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1653.jpg)\n\nIn this photo of the bench, I thought it looked nice and told a little story in itself. The lonely bench with no one sitting on it currently, looking over the waters. I like how the plants up ahead in the lake just happened to align with the bench though. Again, I could have centred it better post-editing. \n![A wooden bench is situated under leafy trees, overlooking a tranquil lake with vegetation on the opposite shore.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1645.jpg)\n\nI loved this overall shot of the lake. I didn't have a wide enough lens with me to really capture it all, but now thinking about it, I should have zoomed in more and captured the area to the left reaching over to the centre of the photo and captured more detail there, perhaps centering the largest tree there to the image. Maybe next time!\n![A serene lake reflects a tree-lined shore and vibrant autumn foliage under a clear blue sky.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1626.jpg)\n\nActually, below is an edit of that photo just to see. Unfortunately though, I don't currently have a powerful enough camera to crop in so much and I lose a lot of the detail. Still cannot wait to get my new camera! And looking at the photo again, I should show the full reflection of that tree in the water too! Live and learn!\n![A tranquil lakeside scene features a red-roofed building and trees with vibrant foliage reflected in the water under a clear blue sky.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/b562ccb216.jpg)\n\nThen I tried something new for me by taking a photo directly into the sun. I noticed a young boy fishing and setting up his rod. The reflection of the sun in the water was nice and I felt this photo looked best in a black and white setting, making the boy look more like a silhouette style photo.\n![A person is fishing on the edge of a calm lake surrounded by trees, with the water reflecting sunlight.](https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/-jdm1650.jpg)\n\nBefore leaving Lake Daylesford, I then took my mother to the local botanical garden known as [Wombat Hill Botanical Garden](https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/daylesford-and-the-macedon-ranges/see-and-do/nature-and-wildlife/parks-and-gardens/wombat-hill-botanic-gardens).

Source - IGN.com</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe game is pretty cool. You play as a pirate and the objective obviously is to go around looking for treasures and getting involved in a lot of piracy by stealing loot from other players as well.\n\nYou sail the seas in a ship that requires other people to be with you to assist with tasks on the ship.

				"title": "The Weekly Recap - Week 19",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I started off the week with some interesting <em>signs</em> being sent to me throughout the day. Bit hard to put into words, but lets just say that the universe was nudging me at the beginning of the week into a certain direction by continuously sending me signals, or, signs. And they were not just coincidental, here are some examples.</p>\n<p>While <em>binge-watching</em> the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/\">silo</a> series, it would continue to pause every 30 seconds to 1 minute - making the watching of it a task. I did not think too much about it at first, until it got so annoying that I thought I would try to time the period between pausing to see if there was some kind of pattern to it. Except, every time I went to try to time it and make sense of it, the timer would reach 5 minutes&hellip;. 10 minutes&hellip;. 15 minutes or more and not a single pause.</p>\n<p>Every time I would stop timing, the darn thing would pause again. Again, I thought nothing too much of it. I tried internet speed test, my connection was perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>This happened more than 10 times. Every time I would try to time it, nothing. I got to a point where I realised what was going on, and I would laugh out loud to myself in my vacant home and just make it do it for kicks&hellip; stop timing it, and then pauses&hellip; time it, no pauses&hellip;</p>\n<p>This was not all that occurred though. When I realised this was a sign and decided I needed to get off the PC. I went to have breakfast. I have a Google HUB that displays Google Photos (yes, I know&hellip; Google&hellip;) I added to a collection years ago. And while I was eating breakfast, I would look at the photo frame and for some reason, the photos I was being shown were very specific.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t just mean one or two photos, but half a dozen or so photos in no random order. These were specific photos of me and my family on the way to specific events or at specific events. Different years, different times of years. But all related to specific events to do with <a href=\"https://en.falundafa.org/\">Falun Dafa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.shenyun.com/\">Shen Yun</a> etc.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that all of the above got me pretty focused for the rest of the week to do my meditation, to read and to tick off all of my daily tasks. And I accomplished those tasks for the whole week which I am quite proud of. This is the reason you&rsquo;ve been seeing a lot more posts from me about <a href=\"https://en.falundafa.org/\">Falun Dafa</a>. And if you&rsquo;re been reading my weeklies, you&rsquo;d have noticed I have been mentioning how much procrastinating I had been doing, and never been truly happy with the lack of tasks I accomplished for myself. Always providing some kind of <em>excuse</em>.</p>\n<p>And no, I was not under the influence of magic mushrooms, DMT, LSD or anything at all for that matter. This was very much normal woken state.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"world-falun-day\">World Falun Day</h2>\n<p>We went to the city for <a href=\"https://faluninfo.net/may13/\">World Falun Day</a> on Saturday, which is a Parade that marches through the city to celebrate the beginning of the <a href=\"https://en.falundafa.org/\">Falun Dafa</a> teachings in China. I posted about it <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/10/the-world-falun-day-parade.html\">here</a> where I included some photos, and then I uploaded some videos of it <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/11/here-are-videos-from-yesterdays.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a much longer video available to watch below which shows the full parade group. I&rsquo;m hidden in there somewhere!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Excuse the shaky video. It wasn&rsquo;t me recording it!</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about my practice, there&rsquo;s plenty of information out there. You can also reach out to me privately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"obsidian\">Obsidian</h2>\n<p>I made <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/08/ive-been-using-obsidian-to.html\">this</a> post which talks about how I have been using Obsidian lately for my journal and how my &ldquo;mycelium&rdquo; network of thoughts has been developing over time and growing.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I really like the plugin for micro.blog that allows me to use a token in order to publish directly from Obsidian to my website.</p>\n<p>Highly recommend you guys get into this as my workflow can go from just posting thoughts throughout the day into a daily entry, that links to separate notes with hashtags and so forth. I can choose to publish a specific note or just keep it private. But what&rsquo;s neat with tags is that over time, on the larger graph that I display tags on, I can see my interests developing and changing over time. I can then hone in on that specific interest and see if there&rsquo;s enough I have linked to and written about that interest over time, to then create a full fledged article from.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-tinkering\">Web Tinkering</h2>\n<p>Last week I tinkered around with my PC. This week I managed to tinker around with my website. I posted about it <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/05/09/ok-while-ticking-away-at.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been pretty happy with the outcome.</p>\n<p>I use to have the main page as just a large About Me, which I felt was just too much information and not straight to the point.</p>\n<p>When I visit others blogs, I like to go to the main domain and see the most recent updates, to see if I have missed anything. So that&rsquo;s precisely what I have gone and done with my website now.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>When you go to my domain <a href=\"https://samuellison.com\">https://samuellison.com</a> you now will see a smaller about section, and then my latest posts and replies to others. They display the markdown, as well as images and video.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s an icon which lets you see if it&rsquo;s a reply or a post of my own. And if you click on them, you can then participate in discussion if it is my own post, and if it&rsquo;s a reply, you can follow a link to the original discussion at the original posters location.</p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty neat, what do you think?</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I really thought I would not have much to discuss from this week, but reading back above, it looks like I was able to share with you quite a bit!</p>\n<p>Again, I hope that you enjoyed reading and learning, and thank you for getting this far.</p>\n<p>Now, back to ticking off my tasks!</p>",

And they were not just coincidental, here are some examples.\n<!--more-->\n\nWhile *binge-watching* the [silo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/) series, it would continue to pause every 30 seconds to 1 minute - making the watching of it a task. I did not think too much about it at first, until it got so annoying that I thought I would try to time the period between pausing to see if there was some kind of pattern to it. Except, every time I went to try to time it and make sense of it, the timer would reach 5 minutes.... 10 minutes.... 15 minutes or more and not a single pause. \n\nEvery time I would stop timing, the darn thing would pause again. Again, I thought nothing too much of it. I tried internet speed test, my connection was perfectly fine. \n\nThis happened more than 10 times. Every time I would try to time it, nothing. I got to a point where I realised what was going on, and I would laugh out loud to myself in my vacant home and just make it do it for kicks... stop timing it, and then pauses... time it, no pauses... \n\nThis was not all that occurred though. When I realised this was a sign and decided I needed to get off the PC. I went to have breakfast. I have a Google HUB that displays Google Photos (yes, I know... Google...) I added to a collection years ago. And while I was eating breakfast, I would look at the photo frame and for some reason, the photos I was being shown were very specific. \n\nI don't just mean one or two photos, but half a dozen or so photos in no random order. These were specific photos of me and my family on the way to specific events or at specific events. Different years, different times of years. But all related to specific events to do with [Falun Dafa](https://en.falundafa.org/) and [Shen Yun](https://www.shenyun.com/) etc.\n\nLet's just say that all of the above got me pretty focused for the rest of the week to do my meditation, to read and to tick off all of my daily tasks. And I accomplished those tasks for the whole week which I am quite proud of. This is the reason you've been seeing a lot more posts from me about [Falun Dafa](https://en.falundafa.org/). And if you're been reading my weeklies, you'd have noticed I have been mentioning how much procrastinating I had been doing, and never been truly happy with the lack of tasks I accomplished for myself. Always providing some kind of *excuse*.\n\nAnd no, I was not under the influence of magic mushrooms, DMT, LSD or anything at all for that matter. This was very much normal woken state.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/1200px-falun-gong-logo.svg.png\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Falun Gong Emblem\">\n\t<figcaption>The Falun Gong Emblem</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## World Falun Day\nWe went to the city for [World Falun Day](https://faluninfo.net/may13/) on Saturday, which is a Parade that marches through the city to celebrate the beginning of the [Falun Dafa](https://en.falundafa.org/) teachings in China. I posted about it [here](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/10/the-world-falun-day-parade.html) where I included some photos, and then I uploaded some videos of it [here](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/11/here-are-videos-from-yesterdays.html).\n\nThere's also a much longer video available to watch below which shows the full parade group. I'm hidden in there somewhere!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.ganjingworld.com/embed/1hkot91drhs6h4McVDaAEgmBs1201c\" title=\"World Falun Dafa Day 2025 parade in Melbourne Australia\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope;\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nExcuse the shaky video. It wasn't me recording it!\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about my practice, there's plenty of information out there. You can also reach out to me privately. \n\n## Obsidian\nI made [this](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/08/ive-been-using-obsidian-to.html) post which talks about how I have been using Obsidian lately for my journal and how my \"mycelium\" network of thoughts has been developing over time and growing.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-05-09-08-08-04.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"562\" alt=\"A complex network diagram with interconnected nodes of various colors and labels on a dark background represents data relationships or organizational structures.\">\n<figcaption>Mycelium network of thoughts and microblogs using Obsidian.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI really like the plugin for micro.blog that allows me to use a token in order to publish directly from Obsidian to my website. \n\nHighly recommend you guys get into this as my workflow can go from just posting thoughts throughout the day into a daily entry, that links to separate notes with hashtags and so forth. I can choose to publish a specific note or just keep it private. But what's neat with tags is that over time, on the larger graph that I display tags on, I can see my interests developing and changing over time. I can then hone in on that specific interest and see if there's enough I have linked to and written about that interest over time, to then create a full fledged article from.\n\n## Web Tinkering\nLast week I tinkered around with my PC. This week I managed to tinker around with my website. I posted about it [here](https://samuellison.com/2025/05/09/ok-while-ticking-away-at.html).\n\nI have been pretty happy with the outcome. \n\nI use to have the main page as just a large About Me, which I felt was just too much information and not straight to the point.\n\nWhen I visit others blogs, I like to go to the main domain and see the most recent updates, to see if I have missed anything. So that's precisely what I have gone and done with my website now.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-05-09-12-11-50.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1138\" alt=\"A personal blog page features an introductory section about Samuel Lison, a sidebar with links, and recent posts, all set against a brown-themed background.\">\n<figcaption>Screenshot of the first page on my blog.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhen you go to my domain https://samuellison.com you now will see a smaller about section, and then my latest posts and replies to others. They display the markdown, as well as images and video. \n\nThere's an icon which lets you see if it's a reply or a post of my own. And if you click on them, you can then participate in discussion if it is my own post, and if it's a reply, you can follow a link to the original discussion at the original posters location.\n\nI think it's pretty neat, what do you think?\n\n## Conclusion\nI really thought I would not have much to discuss from this week, but reading back above, it looks like I was able to share with you quite a bit!\n\nAgain, I hope that you enjoyed reading and learning, and thank you for getting this far. \n\nNow, back to ticking off my tasks!\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I tend to get on the PC with a coffee and get dug into other things that interest me more. But the physical grind is a necessity to reach my other physical goals.</p>\n<p>I keep telling myself that a way around this would be to do the tasks first, before jumping onto the PC to do anything else. Why don&rsquo;t I just do that then? What is it that is stopping myself?</p>\n<h2 id=\"silo-series\">Silo Series</h2>\n<p>In mentioning the above about just getting things done. I can already see where it started. I made <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/i-read-this-article-by.html\">this</a> post about a series called #Silo and then off I went, deep into the rabbit whole that is, a great series.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely #dystopian in nature. It takes some of its likeness from the games known as #Fallout and can be seen somewhat similar to the series with the same name. However, there&rsquo;s no <em>fun</em> twists and no blood and guts all over the place.</p>\n<p>Silo is much more serious, dark, and much more of a thriller. Focused entirely on the inside of the silo, and not so much the apocalyptic exterior.</p>\n<p>In one of the episodes, there is the mention of using something in water, to suppress the peoples memory over a long period of time. Does that remind you of anything still in a majority of <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6320968/\">our water</a>? Have we forgotten why we added flouride to water in the first place? I mean, it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://aquaspace.com/blogs/wow/what-no-one-tells-you-about-fluoride\">only a bi-product </a>of our aluminium, steel, cement, phosphate and nuclear weapons manufacturing. But what do I know?</p>\n<h2 id=\"dark-world-of-trafficking\">Dark world of Trafficking</h2>\n<p>During the week I also made a post about what I believe at least to be another <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/29/pretty-disappointing-really-another-fake.html\">fake suicide</a> related to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. I don&rsquo;t want to go into detail on my thoughts, and will let you do your own digging, out of respect for the family involved, but I wanted to raise the awareness. Getting hit by a bus and in hospital with serious injuries, only for police to be notified about it a whole day later, and to be told minor injuries only? Then, suddenly, the victim decides after all these years, she&rsquo;s had enough and it&rsquo;s time to end it? No more public outreach, no more talking? And to top it off, strange unidentified men at the house? Not detectives or anything like that (unarmed), but well groomed and obviously&hellip; government or secret service in nature.</p>\n<p>The world of human and sex trafficking is dark, and powerful. More needs to be done to unveil all of this and get to the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>That is all I will say.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-diet\">A new Diet?</h2>\n<p>Looking back at the week, I made <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/30/if-we-are-as-well.html\">this post</a> about going back to a whole foods diet. How am I going with that?\nNot real well yet. I have not yet committed to this fully, though I have kept myself aware of it. I am trying to reduce the amount of processed food I rush to when I feel a little hungry. I haven&rsquo;t been successful, as sugars and processed foods are so addictive and I find it one of my biggest weaknesses - especially chocolates.</p>\n<p>This is detrimental really, because all the work I try to put in by exercising, hiking and so forth, is negated and just keeping me where I am.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not overweight or anything like that. I have good strength and cardio fitness. But I really would like to get rid of that stubborn belly fat that lingers, and I know it&rsquo;s mostly from sugars and insulin!</p>\n<p>Supermarkets don&rsquo;t help, do they? Long shelf life. Sweet tasting foods made to get you going back for more. Soft drinks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-pc-tinkering\">More PC Tinkering</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/the-weekly-recap-week.html\">Last week</a> I shared in my weekly recap some PC tinkering I had been doing.

				"content_text": "\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/0697295.jpg\">\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@samuel@samuellison.com\">\nThis last week appears that I focused a little bit more on some of my daily tasks. I managed to do my home-based exercise, at least twice this week instead of the one. I still need to work on my routine and get more of my tasks done. \n\nI tend to get on the PC with a coffee and get dug into other things that interest me more. But the physical grind is a necessity to reach my other physical goals.\n\nI keep telling myself that a way around this would be to do the tasks first, before jumping onto the PC to do anything else. Why don't I just do that then? What is it that is stopping myself?\n<!--more-->\n## Silo Series\nIn mentioning the above about just getting things done. I can already see where it started. I made [this](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/i-read-this-article-by.html) post about a series called #Silo and then off I went, deep into the rabbit whole that is, a great series.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/0697295.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Silo - The Truth Will Surface\">\n\t<figcaption>Silo - The Truth Will Surface</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIt's definitely #dystopian in nature. It takes some of its likeness from the games known as #Fallout and can be seen somewhat similar to the series with the same name. However, there's no *fun* twists and no blood and guts all over the place.\n\nSilo is much more serious, dark, and much more of a thriller. Focused entirely on the inside of the silo, and not so much the apocalyptic exterior.\n\nIn one of the episodes, there is the mention of using something in water, to suppress the peoples memory over a long period of time. Does that remind you of anything still in a majority of [our water](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6320968/)? Have we forgotten why we added flouride to water in the first place? I mean, it's [only a bi-product ](https://aquaspace.com/blogs/wow/what-no-one-tells-you-about-fluoride)of our aluminium, steel, cement, phosphate and nuclear weapons manufacturing. But what do I know?\n\n## Dark world of Trafficking\nDuring the week I also made a post about what I believe at least to be another [fake suicide](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/29/pretty-disappointing-really-another-fake.html) related to [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein). I don't want to go into detail on my thoughts, and will let you do your own digging, out of respect for the family involved, but I wanted to raise the awareness. Getting hit by a bus and in hospital with serious injuries, only for police to be notified about it a whole day later, and to be told minor injuries only? Then, suddenly, the victim decides after all these years, she's had enough and it's time to end it? No more public outreach, no more talking? And to top it off, strange unidentified men at the house? Not detectives or anything like that (unarmed), but well groomed and obviously... government or secret service in nature.\n\nThe world of human and sex trafficking is dark, and powerful. More needs to be done to unveil all of this and get to the bottom of it. \n\nThat is all I will say.\n## A new Diet?\nLooking back at the week, I made [this post](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/30/if-we-are-as-well.html) about going back to a whole foods diet. How am I going with that?\nNot real well yet. I have not yet committed to this fully, though I have kept myself aware of it. I am trying to reduce the amount of processed food I rush to when I feel a little hungry. I haven't been successful, as sugars and processed foods are so addictive and I find it one of my biggest weaknesses - especially chocolates.\n\nThis is detrimental really, because all the work I try to put in by exercising, hiking and so forth, is negated and just keeping me where I am.\n\nI'm not overweight or anything like that. I have good strength and cardio fitness. But I really would like to get rid of that stubborn belly fat that lingers, and I know it's mostly from sugars and insulin!\n\nSupermarkets don't help, do they? Long shelf life. Sweet tasting foods made to get you going back for more. Soft drinks.\n\n## More PC Tinkering\n[Last week](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/28/the-weekly-recap-week.html) I shared in my weekly recap some PC tinkering I had been doing. This week, I added to that with some [Lian Li Strimer ](https://lian-li.com/product/strimer-plus-v2/)cables! I got them for the motherboard, and my graphics card.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250506-164700-956.jpg\" alt=\"A gaming PC setup features vibrant RGB lighting with illuminated fans, components, and cable extensions inside the case. The cable extension also feature RGB lighting. There is a CPU cooler with LCD display on the front showing 29 degrees Celsius. And a graphics card with the text Aurus.\" title=\"Interior PC Case\">\n\t<figcaption>The interior of my PC build at the time of this blog post.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI think I have completed the whole look of my PC now and am happy where it is at.\n\nAll I need now is to just keep it maintained and upgrade as needed when things get too far behind. The next purchase will be to upgrade my NVIDIA 2070 to a 4070 card for my video editing and video recording needs. \n\nThe 2070 is still going strong though and the only benefit I will get currently is a cut in processing time when encoding my videos and some extra frame rates when recording my screen in OBS. \n\nI use an external stream box for streaming in 4K and let it handle my streaming, however, the quality is not as high as I could probably get through software encoding in OBS on the PC itself with a more powerful card!\n\nI'll put that to the test eventually, when I do decide that it is time to upgrade.\n\n## Conclusion\nThat's pretty much it for this week! I also have a *monthly* entry to type up, but I don't know yet if I will keep that to myself or post it on my blog. I'll basically be going through my weekly entries and seeing if I mentioned anything that I didn't follow through with and would just be repeats of information I think.\n\nIf you like what you read, and enjoy reading these, I do appreciate you letting me know!\n\nUntil next week!\n",

				"title": "The Weekly Recap - Week 17",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I had a big week, all things considered. As at the end of this week, we went out all the way to #LakesEntrance as a family. A 4-hour drive each way and loads of activities to do, that the 2 nights were just not enough to get everything done. We definitely have to go back!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In saying that though, having a quick glance at the beginning of the week, and really, as a whole. I did 1 day of my exercise and reading. Once again disappointing myself with my fitness goals, as last week. I can probably forgive myself for the first day, due to it being more of a recovery day from night shift. Looks like I kept myself busy at the start of the week though with a new CPU cooler upgrade and strimer cables for #RGB goodness inside my PC setup. And the end of the week was taken by 3 days on a family trip to Lakes Entrance. Hmm, OK, I can forgive myself here!</p>\n<h2 id=\"pc-tinkering\">PC Tinkering</h2>\n<p>I have had my PC for a good 15 years now and done some hardware upgrades to it along the way to keep it relevant. Recently updating my PC case as well to be able to see what&rsquo;s inside, although I had never been much of a RGB fan prior.</p>\n<p>I think with my new home office setup though, the sit-stand desk that I had custom made and all the other nice nick-nack&rsquo;s to make the room mine, having the PC on display became an objective.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>For years, I had this huge Cooler Master CPU cooler, which actually does a great job with its heat sinks. And late last year during summer, I noticed my PC hitting some kind of limitation with tiny system hangs, frame rate limitations and so forth. This was because, not only was it a warm summer, but I was also doing a lot of live streaming which would put more strain on the system.</p>\n<p>I decided to give the whole PC a clean by pulling it apart. Assuming the CPU cooler needed dust removed to make it more efficient, I pulled that off of the CPU as well.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Unfortunately I cannot find the photo of this, as it was a while ago and not sure where I saved it, but I noticed I had forgotten to remove the piece of plastic that sits on the copper heat-sink and is suppose to have direct contact with the CPU. The piece of plastic clearly had written on it, &ldquo;<strong>WARNING: Remove before use</strong>&rdquo;. I built the whole PC from scratch, so I can&rsquo;t blame someone else for it! So glad my CPU made it through all those years without overheating!</p>\n<p>Removing the sticker improved my system performance significantly and I was off and away back into streaming and making videos for our game <a href=\"https://slcolonies.com\">SL Colonies</a>. But that wasn&rsquo;t before adding a liquid cooled upgrade on my list of things I wanted for the PC.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So I went and finally purchased a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BQWSP2ZP\">Corsair iCUE Liquid CPU Cooler</a> this week with an LCD display, and installed it. What do you think? And now the temperatures on the PC hover around 25 and 26 Celsius constantly. I haven&rsquo;t yet had the opportunity to fully stress test the system with heavy CPU workload, but this is nice, and it really compliments the whole look.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ethernet-issues-gone\">Ethernet Issues Gone</h4>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to report that my <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/24/so-lately-i-have-been.html\">Ethernet issues</a> I had been having for a few months now are gone. I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. I thought it was my <a href=\"https://system76.com/pop/\">Linux distribution</a> causing issues at the kernel level with my Ethernet going to sleep or being managed by the system somehow.</p>\n<p>Basically, randomly, my network would die on the PC, and the only way to get it back, was to physically unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it back in. Not even turning Ethernet on and off seemed to work. And it was happening at random times, not just when walking away from the PC; I could be in the middle of working and the network would go offline.</p>\n<p>This was an issue, as I need a stable connection for my daily needs. Especially for video calls and live streaming. I also run a <a href=\"https://community.torproject.org/relay/\">Tor node</a> in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\">VM</a> which was being affected.</p>\n<p>After much troubleshooting, I was not able to fix it at the motherboard level, and my solution was to purchase a [USB to Ethernet adaptor](<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYTSN18,\">www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYT&hellip;</a> which I am happy to report, has remained online during my 3 days away to Lakes Entrance, returning home to a network that has remained online and functioning as expected!</p>\n<p>Apparently, Intel NIC&rsquo;s are known to have this issue? Have you come across it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"movies\">Movies</h2>\n<p>I watched two movies during the week that I briefly posted about. Those were <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/\">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/\">The Social Dilemma</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Bandersnatch was a great movie. It&rsquo;s very unique, like those <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/choose-your-own-ending\">novels that you can pick your characters ending</a> by choosing your path. Well, Bandersnatch does that in a movie form, where the path you pick throughout the movie, provides you with multiple different types of possible endings, dead-ends and just fun! I loved it, it felt very&hellip; schizophrenic? Don&rsquo;t do LSD kids, not without intention (and a good sitter)!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Social Dilemma on the other hand, was an eye-opener. I mean, I have already made a lot of changes in my life to move away from Social Media and more into my own identity on the web by following <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> principals. As well as completely <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/how-to-de-google\">DeGoogling</a> my life - especially on my phone! My phone is practically a brick with the bare minimum apps to suit my <em>needs</em> and nothing more. But I have taken it further, by not just <em>DeGoogling</em>, but also DeApping. So no emails, no social media, no nothing. The phone does two things. Handle phone calls, and messaging (encrypted through my own self-hosted <a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a> instance). Other than that, my phone is in airplane mode, connected to home WiFi. Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off, all tracking off and running on <a href=\"https://grapheneos.org/\">GrapheneOS</a>.  Highly recommend watching this documentary - it will open your eyes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"car-maintenance\">Car Maintenance</h2>\n<p>I did a little car maintenance on my wife&rsquo;s vehicle. I&rsquo;m not very hands on and definitely not a mechanic, unlike my brother. But I changed some light globes for the headlights and number plates and got my hands dirty. It&rsquo;s an old Toyota Camry Altise - I think 2015 odd? She&rsquo;s getting old, but still very reliable.</p>\n<p>Actually need to arrange with my brother to do its shock absorbers, as they&rsquo;ve reached their end-of-life!</p>\n<h2 id=\"voting\">Voting</h2>\n<p>We had to vote in Victoria for state parliament and local government. I did something different this year, as usually I just vote based on what I know personally, and that&rsquo;s nothing&hellip; as I really am not interested in any politics. But that is the wrong way to vote, and I fear a lot of us vote like I did.</p>\n<h4 id=\"i-used-ai\">I used AI</h4>\n<p>Yes, you read right. I used AI to help me in making my informed decision. And no, I don&rsquo;t mean that I typed into the prompt, <em>&ldquo;Who do you recommend I vote for?</em>&rdquo; - that would be outright stupid.</p>\n<p>But I used AI as a tool to help me make my informed decision, and it performed very well.</p>\n<p>Basically, first I got AI to help me setup a score matrix spreadsheet. Where I listed topics that were important to me, not important to me and topics I was against. Each with their own score based on importance to me.</p>\n<p>For me, digital privacy, encryption, security, open source solutions and so forth are my top priorities. Among many others of course which I wont discuss here publicly.

This is good though, as it means I take a rest at least every 2 hours and stretch the legs.</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing about electric vehicles, in my opinion, is that when you do need to charge on a long road trip, you get to leave the car plugged in and all get out of the car to go for a walk, go for a bite to eat in the local town and enjoy the scenery before continuing. I think this in itself will help with the road toll of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We started our trip with a visit of the <a href=\"https://raymondisland.net/\">Raymond Island</a>, which included a trip on the Raymond Island Ferry. The island has hundreds of koalas that you can see while going on walks around. There are some trails marked out on <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/south-raymond-island-foreshore-walk\">AllTrails</a> you can check out if you like, but you can basically walk anywhere along the Island and you are sure to find koalas all over the place.

As at the end of this week, we went out all the way to #LakesEntrance as a family. A 4-hour drive each way and loads of activities to do, that the 2 nights were just not enough to get everything done. We definitely have to go back!\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/8355990095-a4c439fcd2-b.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"The Entrance - Lakes Entrance\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo courtesy of Alpha on Flikr: [www.flickr.com/photos/av...](https://www.flickr.com/photos/avlxyz/)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn saying that though, having a quick glance at the beginning of the week, and really, as a whole. I did 1 day of my exercise and reading. Once again disappointing myself with my fitness goals, as last week. I can probably forgive myself for the first day, due to it being more of a recovery day from night shift. Looks like I kept myself busy at the start of the week though with a new CPU cooler upgrade and strimer cables for #RGB goodness inside my PC setup. And the end of the week was taken by 3 days on a family trip to Lakes Entrance. Hmm, OK, I can forgive myself here!\n\n## PC Tinkering\nI have had my PC for a good 15 years now and done some hardware upgrades to it along the way to keep it relevant. Recently updating my PC case as well to be able to see what's inside, although I had never been much of a RGB fan prior. \n\nI think with my new home office setup though, the sit-stand desk that I had custom made and all the other nice nick-nack's to make the room mine, having the PC on display became an objective.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250428-122237.jpg-compressed.jpeg\" alt=\"A tidy home office with a wooden desk, large monitor, tablet, keyboard, and mouse. Two LED panel lights, studio speakers, and a microphone are set up for recording. A colourful, illuminated PC is on the floor. Above the desk are three framed artworks and decorative fans on a shelf. Astronomy and astrological symbols are painted on the ceiling.\" title=\"Photo of my Office Setup\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo of my office setup including my sit-stand desk with custom made wood top. Colour PC, mechnical keyboard, large 43 inch Samsung monitor, studio speakers and mic, and... more... </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFor years, I had this huge Cooler Master CPU cooler, which actually does a great job with its heat sinks. And late last year during summer, I noticed my PC hitting some kind of limitation with tiny system hangs, frame rate limitations and so forth. This was because, not only was it a warm summer, but I was also doing a lot of live streaming which would put more strain on the system.\n\nI decided to give the whole PC a clean by pulling it apart. Assuming the CPU cooler needed dust removed to make it more efficient, I pulled that off of the CPU as well. \n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/img-20250422-110513-165.jpg\" alt=\"A gaming PC with RGB lighting inside a glass-fronted case displays vibrant colours and internal components.\" title=\"Photo of PC with large cooler fan\">\n\t<figcaption>Photo of my PC just prior to installing Liquid Cooled CPU Cooler.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nUnfortunately I cannot find the photo of this, as it was a while ago and not sure where I saved it, but I noticed I had forgotten to remove the piece of plastic that sits on the copper heat-sink and is suppose to have direct contact with the CPU. The piece of plastic clearly had written on it, \"**WARNING: Remove before use**\". I built the whole PC from scratch, so I can't blame someone else for it! So glad my CPU made it through all those years without overheating! \n\nRemoving the sticker improved my system performance significantly and I was off and away back into streaming and making videos for our game [SL Colonies](https://slcolonies.com). But that wasn't before adding a liquid cooled upgrade on my list of things I wanted for the PC.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/1000000523.jpg\" alt=\"A gaming PC with colorful RGB lighting and multiple cooling fans is displayed through a transparent side panel.\" title=\"My PC with Liquid Cooled CPU Cooler\">\n\t<figcaption>Behold, the Corsair iCUE Liquid CPU Cooler.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo I went and finally purchased a [Corsair iCUE Liquid CPU Cooler](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BQWSP2ZP) this week with an LCD display, and installed it. What do you think? And now the temperatures on the PC hover around 25 and 26 Celsius constantly. I haven't yet had the opportunity to fully stress test the system with heavy CPU workload, but this is nice, and it really compliments the whole look.\n#### Ethernet Issues Gone\nI'm also happy to report that my [Ethernet issues](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/24/so-lately-i-have-been.html) I had been having for a few months now are gone. I couldn't figure it out. I thought it was my [Linux distribution](https://system76.com/pop/) causing issues at the kernel level with my Ethernet going to sleep or being managed by the system somehow. \n\nBasically, randomly, my network would die on the PC, and the only way to get it back, was to physically unplug the Ethernet cable and plug it back in. Not even turning Ethernet on and off seemed to work. And it was happening at random times, not just when walking away from the PC; I could be in the middle of working and the network would go offline. \n\nThis was an issue, as I need a stable connection for my daily needs. Especially for video calls and live streaming. I also run a [Tor node](https://community.torproject.org/relay/) in a [VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which was being affected.\n\nAfter much troubleshooting, I was not able to fix it at the motherboard level, and my solution was to purchase a [USB to Ethernet adaptor]([www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYT...](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B00MYTSN18,) which I am happy to report, has remained online during my 3 days away to Lakes Entrance, returning home to a network that has remained online and functioning as expected!\n\nApparently, Intel NIC's are known to have this issue? Have you come across it?\n\n## Movies\nI watched two movies during the week that I briefly posted about. Those were [Black Mirror: Bandersnatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9495224/) and [The Social Dilemma](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/).\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/mv5bmjm5mzgzmjm3of5bml5banbnxkftztgwmzq2mzqwnzm.-v1-.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork for the Netflix Original, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\" title=\"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\">\n\t<figcaption>Artwork for the Netflix Original, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBandersnatch was a great movie. It's very unique, like those [novels that you can pick your characters ending](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/choose-your-own-ending) by choosing your path. Well, Bandersnatch does that in a movie form, where the path you pick throughout the movie, provides you with multiple different types of possible endings, dead-ends and just fun! I loved it, it felt very... schizophrenic? Don't do LSD kids, not without intention (and a good sitter)!\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/aaaabbzitvp9iwps-lz6n9tf6bgllt49qsgdrijqip-vlor0ocihij2caq0guqps5acmekylhmb.jpeg\" alt=\"Artwork for The Social Dilemma documentary\" title=\"The Social Dilemma\">\n\t<figcaption>Artwork for The Social Dilemma documentary.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe Social Dilemma on the other hand, was an eye-opener. I mean, I have already made a lot of changes in my life to move away from Social Media and more into my own identity on the web by following [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) principals. As well as completely [DeGoogling](https://proton.me/blog/how-to-de-google) my life - especially on my phone! My phone is practically a brick with the bare minimum apps to suit my *needs* and nothing more. But I have taken it further, by not just *DeGoogling*, but also DeApping. So no emails, no social media, no nothing. The phone does two things. Handle phone calls, and messaging (encrypted through my own self-hosted [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) instance). Other than that, my phone is in airplane mode, connected to home WiFi. Bluetooth and WiFi scanning off, all tracking off and running on [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).  Highly recommend watching this documentary - it will open your eyes.\n## Car Maintenance\nI did a little car maintenance on my wife's vehicle. I'm not very hands on and definitely not a mechanic, unlike my brother. But I changed some light globes for the headlights and number plates and got my hands dirty. It's an old Toyota Camry Altise - I think 2015 odd? She's getting old, but still very reliable. \n\nActually need to arrange with my brother to do its shock absorbers, as they've reached their end-of-life!\n\n## Voting\nWe had to vote in Victoria for state parliament and local government. I did something different this year, as usually I just vote based on what I know personally, and that's nothing... as I really am not interested in any politics. But that is the wrong way to vote, and I fear a lot of us vote like I did.\n\n#### I used AI\nYes, you read right. I used AI to help me in making my informed decision. And no, I don't mean that I typed into the prompt, *\"Who do you recommend I vote for?*\" - that would be outright stupid.\n\nBut I used AI as a tool to help me make my informed decision, and it performed very well.\n\nBasically, first I got AI to help me setup a score matrix spreadsheet. Where I listed topics that were important to me, not important to me and topics I was against. Each with their own score based on importance to me.\n\nFor me, digital privacy, encryption, security, open source solutions and so forth are my top priorities. Among many others of course which I wont discuss here publicly. But AI was able to work a uniquely tailored scoring system for me.\n\nSo then, there were 16 parties for me to rank based on my scoring. And AI helped here by writing me, essentially, an essay on each party and their representatives, one by one and scoring with me, giving each party a **total**. \n\nI made sure to look out for any controversial topics. Scoured the web for sources on anything that would raise red flags for me to lower my preferences for a certain person or party.\n\nIn the end, I had 16 parties in order of preference that I was able to make informed decisions about to cast my vote. \n\nI would not recommend AI to give you its own opinions about people or parties. Remember that AI is an LLM and gathers its information from the WWW and will base its *opinions* on others opinions and not your own. Also, remember that opinions can be coded in by those who control the software. \n\nWhat you need, are sources you can read, watch and listen to.\n\nThe process I used took a full day for me with everything else on hold. It was worth it, and I felt better using this method than my old method. \n\nOh, and here's a funny video I recommend you watch, just for a laugh:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtVJ4JDM7eM?si=omESCjyqmWZkZyv_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFunny right?\n## Lakes Entrance\nOver the #AnzacDay long weekend, I took the family out to #LakesEntrance which is a 4 hour drive from #Melbourne and with my Tesla, requires at least one charge on route. This is good though, as it means I take a rest at least every 2 hours and stretch the legs. \n\nThe beautiful thing about electric vehicles, in my opinion, is that when you do need to charge on a long road trip, you get to leave the car plugged in and all get out of the car to go for a walk, go for a bite to eat in the local town and enjoy the scenery before continuing. I think this in itself will help with the road toll of drivers falling asleep at the wheel.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/raymond-island-aerial-view-r-147800-1600x1200.jpeg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the Raymond Island in Gippsland, Victoria\" title=\"Raymond Island\">\n\t<figcaption>Aerial photograph of Raymond Island, courtesy of [visitmelbourne.com](https://visitmelbourne.com)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe started our trip with a visit of the [Raymond Island](https://raymondisland.net/), which included a trip on the Raymond Island Ferry.

Hidden inside a motel carpark, we found it to be a hidden gem, with authentic and extra-tasty Malaysian Cuisine.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Looking at the whole week, I can already see that my routine was really put out of whack due to #NightShift. I don&rsquo;t know if I am just making excuses up, but it really does feel that way. I was not able to get my sleep pattern right, mostly breaking my 6 to 8 hour sleep period into two cycles. One perhaps within an hour of getting home from work, trying to sleep for 3 to 4 hours, and then waking up for a couple of hours and getting another 2 to 3 hours at the end of the day prior to heading off to work.</p>\n<p>During my period of time awake, I really did not feel like doing my daily 30 minutes of skipping, reading, or meditating. I really should have pushed more.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say now, at the end of the week and looking back at the daily journal entries - it was a daily mental push to give myself excuses to do other things with my time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-do-for-work\">What I do for work</h2>\n<p>Not sure I would call it work, as I actually do love my job. I&rsquo;m not sure the English language has any appropriate words for it? If you can help me out here, let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>The only reason I am delving more into this area of my life is because I happened to have discussions with someone in comments of my #thoughts posts on the #fediverse and answering a few questions throughout.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;m a police officer where I live, and I really enjoy helping people out when they need it most. I know a lot of us get jaded, joining a dream job only to find the reality of it is not what you think - but it really does take a certain mentality to look at the profession from different angles and to shift your focus from <em>crime centric</em> to <em>victim centric</em> and focusing on helping out the victim, communicating with the victim throughout the whole process.</p>\n<p>We are trained when going to a job to focus on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender. A lot of us get stuck in tunnel vision and want the fun stuff, chasing the offender and missing all the initial actions necessary for an investigation to be successful at court. And even more so, a lot of us forget in all of that, about the victim. Focusing only on the desired outcome with the offender.</p>\n<p>In the end, that leads to burnout. As this job has tonnes of paperwork involved (at least in Victoria). Focusing on the outcome of the offender only to get a result at court that is essentially a slap on the wrist brings you down - and then, because you never focused on the victim - the victim is wondering what&rsquo;s happened since police arrived - did police do nothing? You as a member now have no rapport with the victim.</p>\n<p>If you keep yourself focused on Victim -&gt; Scene -&gt; Offender, not just at the initial job, but throughout the whole process, you are more likely to enjoy the full process, as is the victim going to understand the process by being spoken to like a human being, remembered and guided throughout. While the outcome at court may be the same result - your mind has been on helping a member of the community understand the process and know the likely outcome. This leads to a member of the community who understands the process we go through, understands the law system a little more, and is more likely to speak up to MP&rsquo;s or within the community about our law system to make desired changes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is one method I have come to enjoy my line of work in the mountain of paperwork and lack of time to do it.</p>\n<p>Another method I have come to keep enjoying it, is #compartmentalising and using my daily journal keeping, and my blogging on my own domain name. Gone are the days of sitting on social media, scrolling an endless feed of algorithmically curated content to drain my stream of consciousness and just <em>consume</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"black-mirror\">Black Mirror</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Another method I kept myself sane during what time I had awake after night shift was to delve into the #BlackMIrror series. Season 7 was released, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist digging in, as I really enjoy this series as someone that doesn&rsquo;t actually watch TV anymore or go down the #YouTube rabbit holes and such.</p>\n<p>Season 7 was really well done. I enjoyed every episode in it. I initially thought it would be like Season 6 and out of touch with the rest of the seasons, but this season did not disappoint in any way.</p>\n<p>Looking at the world from different aspects of <em>what could</em> be with today&rsquo;s technology, or soon to have technology with a bit of a satanical twist to them really makes for an interesting watch.</p>\n<p>The first episode actually had me on a downer! And above I was saying keep myself sane by watching this season? Episode 1 was a drainer and <a href=\"https://samuellison.com/2025/04/14/043923.html\">I thought I&rsquo;d need a psych</a> to reground myself into reality!</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to go into any more detail about it, but you really should take the time out to watch them if you haven&rsquo;t.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ai--llms\">AI / LLM&rsquo;s</h2>\n<p>Speaking of Black Mirror and technology - this week I felt that the LLM&rsquo;s I had been using for discussions and troubleshooting felt off. #GPT and #DeepSeek were hallucinating information a lot more and spitting out false information to me, leading me down tracks of nonsense.</p>\n<p>I was trying to troubleshoot and looking into content management systems that had built in #AcivityPub backends for my website.</p>\n<p>Currently, I use micro.blog to host my website, and rely on its backend that enables me to follow people on the fediverse and comment/reply to their content and have discussions. It also enables my posts on my blog to appear on the fediverse and for any replies to end up on my website as well.</p>\n<p>Micro.blog allows for the exporting of all posts and what not, which is great! But if I wanted to self-host, as well as keep my fediverse identity (@samuel@samuellison.com) I would also need a system that has an ActivityPub backend that is not just a platform with no ability to customise into a full website like what you are reading from now. I can use Mastodon, Pixelfed, GoToSocial, WriteFreely etc, but none of those offer what I need.</p>\n<p>The LLM&rsquo;s were spitting out so much false information that I was down a rabbit hole for 2 hours before I realised this was all nonsense. The LLM&rsquo;s finally admitted that they were wrong when pressed, and that their information was based on &ldquo;<em>theoretical features</em>&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t yet exist!</p>\n<p>Could it be that the #AISlop that is appearing more and more on the internet is causing #AI to become more useless when it comes to providing us with information?</p>\n<p>I mean, a lot of content these days, including articles, stories, news, videos - are all AI generated by people that are prompting AI to write it. This makes AI gather the information it needs from the internet, assess, and then spit out the work for you.</p>\n<p>Then, the next person does the same. AI repeats, gathers its information from itself (from AI generated content already on the web now - repeat) and spits out even more useless information.</p>\n<p>Then, you have companies like #CloudFlare, a content delivery network, that attempts to protect its clientele by creating <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/\">sophisticated <em>mazes</em></a> where AI is lead down these rabbit holes of information it thinks it is obtaining from legitimate sources, which is actually in itself being created on the fly by other AI technology and feeding the requesting AI/LLM with misinformation.</p>\n<p>Have you noticed this starting to happen?</p>\n<p>I personally think it&rsquo;s a good thing. I mean, LLM&rsquo;s have been stealing the work of artists and writers now for some time. Why are we going in the direction of AI replacing all our jobs, instead of making AI useful? Where are these AI that can come do my washing, my dishes, my gardening and other duties around the household to enable me to have more free time to do what I enjoy to do during my spare time?</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t need my job replaced by AI, I&rsquo;m sure none of you do. All this talk of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o\"><em>universal basic income</em></a> and the likes. What will we do with our time, if what we enjoy to do is taken by AI? I hope not Episode 2, Season 1 of Black Mirror - <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2089049/\">Fifteen Million Merits</a>!</p>\n<h2 id=\"family-visiting\">Family Visiting</h2>\n<p>I had family visiting from Brisbane during my time doing night shifts. Means I missed out on a lot of opportune family time with members of the family I don&rsquo;t generally get to see on a regular basis, which is a shame. But we did still get a few things done as family where I got to be involved. Including celebrating my father in laws 70th birthday with some wonderful food at #BoardWalkPizzeria in #CarolineSprings.</p>\n<p>Also got to celebrate an Easter dinner with the family and cousins and all the kids. We guys played a few board games, including #munchkins and #Catan! My cousin made some beautiful #pizza which we all enjoyed very much!</p>\n<h2 id=\"john-carpenters-they-live\">John Carpenter&rsquo;s: They Live</h2>\n<p>Saying that I generally don&rsquo;t watch movies is somewhat of a lie. After seeing a post by <a href=\"https://defcon.social/@n1ghtw1re\">@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social</a> suggesting to go watch <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/\">They Live</a> by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/\">John Carpenter</a> I went and did just that. I <em>can</em> be swayed into watching movies by those I choose to follow and consume information from - I suppose!</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Actually quite a good movie indeed! Made in 1988 and having a Black Mirror kind of vibe where humanity has actually been taken over by an alien race, and we are stuck in this illusionary hypnotised state of consuming information and complying.</p>\n<p>Actually there&rsquo;s a line in this movie which is featured in the Duke Nukem games, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I&rsquo;m all outta gum&rdquo;, vs the original movie quote, &ldquo;I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass&hellip; and I&rsquo;m all outta bubblegum&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Actually, the game was somewhat inspired by this movie. Not only in the line, but the hog police (aliens), the whole look of Duke Nukem and more!</p>\n<p>Check out the article written by <a href=\"https://micro.blog/n1ghtw1re@defcon.social\">@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social</a> <a href=\"https://circuit-breach.neocities.org/articles/put-on-the-glasses-they-live\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you read my blurb of consciousness recapping on my week, good on you, and thank you. I hope that you enjoyed it and I look forward to making another recap next week to reflect on and look back to in the future!</p>",

I initially thought it would be like Season 6 and out of touch with the rest of the seasons, but this season did not disappoint in any way.\n\nLooking at the world from different aspects of *what could* be with today's technology, or soon to have technology with a bit of a satanical twist to them really makes for an interesting watch.\n\nThe first episode actually had me on a downer! And above I was saying keep myself sane by watching this season? Episode 1 was a drainer and [I thought I'd need a psych](https://samuellison.com/2025/04/14/043923.html) to reground myself into reality!\n\nI don't want to go into any more detail about it, but you really should take the time out to watch them if you haven't.\n\n## AI / LLM's\nSpeaking of Black Mirror and technology - this week I felt that the LLM's I had been using for discussions and troubleshooting felt off. #GPT and #DeepSeek were hallucinating information a lot more and spitting out false information to me, leading me down tracks of nonsense.\n\nI was trying to troubleshoot and looking into content management systems that had built in #AcivityPub backends for my website. \n\nCurrently, I use micro.blog to host my website, and rely on its backend that enables me to follow people on the fediverse and comment/reply to their content and have discussions. It also enables my posts on my blog to appear on the fediverse and for any replies to end up on my website as well. \n\nMicro.blog allows for the exporting of all posts and what not, which is great! But if I wanted to self-host, as well as keep my fediverse identity (@samuel@samuellison.com) I would also need a system that has an ActivityPub backend that is not just a platform with no ability to customise into a full website like what you are reading from now. I can use Mastodon, Pixelfed, GoToSocial, WriteFreely etc, but none of those offer what I need.\n\nThe LLM's were spitting out so much false information that I was down a rabbit hole for 2 hours before I realised this was all nonsense. The LLM's finally admitted that they were wrong when pressed, and that their information was based on \"*theoretical features*\" that didn't yet exist!\n\nCould it be that the #AISlop that is appearing more and more on the internet is causing #AI to become more useless when it comes to providing us with information?\n\nI mean, a lot of content these days, including articles, stories, news, videos - are all AI generated by people that are prompting AI to write it. This makes AI gather the information it needs from the internet, assess, and then spit out the work for you.\n\nThen, the next person does the same. AI repeats, gathers its information from itself (from AI generated content already on the web now - repeat) and spits out even more useless information.\n\nThen, you have companies like #CloudFlare, a content delivery network, that attempts to protect its clientele by creating [sophisticated *mazes*](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-labyrinth/) where AI is lead down these rabbit holes of information it thinks it is obtaining from legitimate sources, which is actually in itself being created on the fly by other AI technology and feeding the requesting AI/LLM with misinformation.\n\nHave you noticed this starting to happen? \n\nI personally think it's a good thing. I mean, LLM's have been stealing the work of artists and writers now for some time. Why are we going in the direction of AI replacing all our jobs, instead of making AI useful? Where are these AI that can come do my washing, my dishes, my gardening and other duties around the household to enable me to have more free time to do what I enjoy to do during my spare time?\n\nI don't need my job replaced by AI, I'm sure none of you do. All this talk of [*universal basic income*](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnd607ekl99o) and the likes. What will we do with our time, if what we enjoy to do is taken by AI? I hope not Episode 2, Season 1 of Black Mirror - [Fifteen Million Merits](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2089049/)!\n\n## Family Visiting\nI had family visiting from Brisbane during my time doing night shifts. Means I missed out on a lot of opportune family time with members of the family I don't generally get to see on a regular basis, which is a shame. But we did still get a few things done as family where I got to be involved. Including celebrating my father in laws 70th birthday with some wonderful food at #BoardWalkPizzeria in #CarolineSprings. \n\nAlso got to celebrate an Easter dinner with the family and cousins and all the kids. We guys played a few board games, including #munchkins and #Catan! My cousin made some beautiful #pizza which we all enjoyed very much!\n\n## John Carpenter's: They Live\nSaying that I generally don't watch movies is somewhat of a lie. After seeing a post by [@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social](https://defcon.social/@n1ghtw1re) suggesting to go watch [They Live](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/) by [John Carpenter](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/) I went and did just that. I *can* be swayed into watching movies by those I choose to follow and consume information from - I suppose!\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/theylive.jpg\" alt=\"Artwork for the John Carpenter Movie - They Live\" title=\"John Carpenter: They Live\">\n\t<figcaption>Artwork for John Carpenter's 1988 movie - They Live</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nActually quite a good movie indeed! Made in 1988 and having a Black Mirror kind of vibe where humanity has actually been taken over by an alien race, and we are stuck in this illusionary hypnotised state of consuming information and complying.\n\nActually there's a line in this movie which is featured in the Duke Nukem games, \"It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum, and I'm all outta gum\", vs the original movie quote, \"I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all outta bubblegum\". \n\nActually, the game was somewhat inspired by this movie. Not only in the line, but the hog police (aliens), the whole look of Duke Nukem and more!\n\nCheck out the article written by [@n1ghtw1re@defcon.social](https://micro.blog/n1ghtw1re@defcon.social) [here](https://circuit-breach.neocities.org/articles/put-on-the-glasses-they-live).\n## Conclusion\nIf you read my blurb of consciousness recapping on my week, good on you, and thank you. I hope that you enjoyed it and I look forward to making another recap next week to reflect on and look back to in the future!\n",

				"content_text": "\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/bffec7772b.jpg\">\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@samuel@samuellison.com\">\nI thought I would try something new this week with my weekly journal entries where I would normally just quickly look through the last 7 days and note down to myself what I have done well or not. \n\nBasically, why don't I do a recap that goes through what I accomplished for the week based on a lot of the daily notes I made and go into more detail, since larger long-form content allows for more characters and space to just let it all out and stretch?\n<!--more-->\n## Onto the Recap!\n\nAlthough I don't feel I ticked off enough of my *daily tasks* such as regular skipping/jump-roping, reading, meditating and what not, I feel like I did have a busy week and a lot of debriefing to do with myself. There's a lot to unpack here and more that I will need to write about, now that I come to think of it.\n\n## Some things I did\n\n### Phillip Island\nJust at the end of last week, the family and I took off to #PhillipIsland and stayed by a beach house. In one of my notes, I state that I should write more of an article about it, yet, I have not yet done so. I need to add this to my list of things to do!\n\nI did at least make a video of it for the family to see, but nothing public about it to discuss where we went, what it was like out there, what did we see? \n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/bffec7772b.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Phillip Island - Nobby's Point\">\n\t<figcaption>A photo I took at Phillip Island around Nobby's Point of a blowhole.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nStay-tuned, as I may update this post later when I make the journal entry about our trip as a whole.\n\n### An unsuspected death \nSometimes life throws you curve-balls, and unfortunately we recently had one of those. \n\nMy eldest daughter has been taking #guitar lessons for a while and had this really great elderly teacher who seemed so happy, so healthy. Until one day, he would try to speak, yet no words come out.\n\nThe teacher ended up in hospital for a few days. We all assumed something like #Apraxia or something similar that affected the brain and his ability to form words.\n\nIn actuality, it was a #melanoma in the chest, a #cancer, that had already taken over and it was too late. The teacher was given a week to live from that diagnosis. \n\nUnfortunately I did not get to take my daughter to visit the teacher to say her goodbyes, as it was already too late and coma had set in and it would not have been appropriate. \n\n### New UPS\nI purchased a new #UPS for our #NAS due to power surges happening during the week as well. This should greatly reduce the risk of permanent damage due to surges on the NAS, modem and switches. I've also set the NAS up to auto shut down when power goes out and the NAS uses battery backup.\n\n### Vibe Coding - The new Buzz Word out there.\nI did a little bit of #VibeCoding in #OpenSimulator and worked a little more on #SurvivorCore. Just added some \"consumable\" scripts to increase or decrease any survival stats in the game.\n\n### Kids Homework\nI found out that my youngest daughter had not been doing her homework properly as she's been more focused on wanting to play #Roblox on grandma's iPad upstairs while her older sister would play on the XBOX.  \n\nI went and put some restrictions on the internet to try prevent them playing while I am at work straight after school, and try to get them to focus on doing their chores and homework prior to any games.\n\nBecause the kids enjoy their iPads as much as I enjoy my #Linux computing - I've encouraged them to take photos of their homework and tutoring and send to my mother who does their tutoring, to show the completed work and get daily feedback via video calls and what not. \n\n### A New Job, New Opportunities\nI caught up with an old friend prior to him having to fly to #Canberra for his new job. Was great to catch up.\n\nHe'll be gone for 12 to 15 weeks for the training before being brought back here to #Melbourne to do the role he applied for and was a successful applicant for.\n\nIt's great when you see friends achieve a goal they had set and get into a dream job they had been trying at for years.\n\nThere is always a light at the end of the tunnel, somewhere out there. You just gotta find it.\n\n### Hiking - Werribee Gorge\nI went for a #hike to #WerribeeGorge with the girls and this was a lot of fun. I should make a #CaptainsLog post about this as well. Stay tuned for that one as I will make another journal entry there and update this article to point to it to prove it!\n\nI'm very proud of my kids for accomplishing this one as it was challenging enough for such youngins.\n\n### Obsidian, a new tool\nI also did a lot of playing around on #Obsidian to improve on my #journal workflow. I used it for this article, and am using it now for all my #microblog entries and notes. \n\nIt allows me to organise all my thoughts in a map, to publish straight to my website and to the #fediverse as well.\n\nI've found I've been more productive using this tool - though, maybe that's just a feeling? Is writing your thoughts and journal considered a form of procrastination in and of itself? We will see when I look back in a few months, or years, won't we?\n\nI get to keep short notes within a larger daily entry. I can look back at the whole week and then make a post like this one to reflect on the whole week - see where I can improve on and so on...\n\nI can also use it as a link aggregator in my short micro entries. Posting a link of a website I looked at and found interesting, and briefly talk about the subject matter. If I find I am talking about a certain #hashtag over and over, I can see an obvious trend in my current interests and choose to post in more detail about it.\n\n## On to Next Week\nAnyway, I have more things to do. This was my first weekly recap. I plan to do more - but alas, there's only so much time in a day!\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Last month, I went for a final hike in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerderderg_Gorge\">Lerderderg Gorge</a> basically, at the end of summer. And unfortunately, most of the Lerderderg Gorge hiking trails will be closed over Autumn due to planned burning.</p>\n<p>These are done, essentially, to keep us, and the surrounds safe here in Australia by minimising the damage a bush fire causes in the more dangerous and drier months.</p>\n<p>So for now, Lerderderg will unfortunately not be on my list of locations for fungi photography until a little later in the year. Hopefully I will be able to find some sturdier species coming into winter though!</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-is-lerderderg\">Where is Lerderderg?</h2>\n<p>The Lerderderg State park is just north of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_Marsh\">Bacchus Marsh</a> in Victoria, Australia. It is a gorge that has been carved out of the rugged landscape by the Lerderderg River.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In early 1851, the area was reputed to be a hot spot for gold mining, and At its peak saw thousands of diggers arrive looking for the lucrative mineral.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in hiking this beautiful location, you can check out the AllTrails entry here: <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit\">https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-adventure\">The Adventure</h2>\n<p>In this section of the log, I am going to go on and on about my last hike around the Lerderderg Circuit Track. But, if you want to see and hear it first hand instead of read, you can do so by watching this 3.5 hour video of my hike below.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"the-beginning\">The Beginning</h3>\n<p>I set off early in the morning, but due to the weather known to be cooler, I didn&rsquo;t start my hike in the cool or the darkness of the night.</p>\n<p>It was early morning and I strapped my <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/au/osmo-action-5-pro\">DJI Action</a> onto my chest to get some Point of View (POV) footage of the entire hike to make a video out of it for those interested. That should be embedded for you above for you to watch. If it doesn&rsquo;t work, let me know in the comments and I will embed from an alternative source!</p>\n<p>I brought a <a href=\"https://rode.com/en/microphones/on-camera/videomic-pro\">R0DE VideoMic Pro</a> Microphone as well, linked up with <a href=\"https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelesspro\">Rode Wireless Pro&rsquo;s</a> to capture any sounds with some more detail, as that&rsquo;s something I would also like to increase my skills in, and then I set off down the beautiful trail.</p>\n<p>At this time of the year, there&rsquo;s usually no flowing water along the river, so the river crossings are easier and you can keep your feet dry, but I will say that having flowing water along a majority of the hike sets a beautiful sound and scenery to enjoy alongside you - so I will be returning here with flowing water with this new equipment. My first attempt at recording this location was using my <a href=\"https://makertube.net/w/pySqnnSGD6dAryQ3fcrHNW\">mobile phone</a> which while the quality was high, it doesn&rsquo;t leave enough room for editing the colours just right to my own liking.</p>\n<p>Here are a few sound recordings that I took along the hike. I hope that you enjoy listening to them as much as I enjoyed the recording of them.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"difficulties\">Difficulties</h3>\n<p>This time around, I felt much fitter than my first attempt. Yes, it was cooler, and that would have helped some, but I also felt my cardiovascular and my fitness in general was up to standard for this hike.</p>\n<p>There are a couple scrambles which actually require you to use your hands to hold onto the rocks to help yourself up, but nothing too difficult. You just need to be a little careful if you are like me and like to <a href=\"https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/\">ruck</a> your pack. Basically, I enjoy having a 15kg or more backpack on. Not only due to my requirement for photography equipment, but <a href=\"https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/\">rucking</a> is also a form of exercise and increases my strength needs when hiking, especially when going up and really getting into those leg muscles.</p>\n<p>Going down means I have to go slower, and trekking poles are really a necessity, as falls are more likely with a heavier backpack when not careful of the extra weight.</p>\n<p>Even climbing sometimes, it requires you to activate your core muscles more and take notice of your centre of gravity point, as leaning back a little too much, you&rsquo;ll find that you struggle to keep a balance!</p>\n<p>I wish I already had a heart rate monitor and my handheld GPS tracker, as I would like to wear a strap heart rate monitor that tracks my heart rate along the hike, that I can then overlay across the whole video of the hike. That way, you can get a feel of how easy or how difficult a portion of what I am doing might be, based on my own fitness levels - but I am no athlete!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A smart watch with built in heart rate wont do it for me. New ones aren&rsquo;t what they use to be, in my opinion, and their privacy policies are all as bad as each other, require proprietary software to read data from which these companies data mine you for. I will give what data I want to publish thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-top\">The Top</h3>\n<p>At the top of the mountain, I was approximately 440 or 450m above sea level. I wouldn&rsquo;t be grading the difficulty of a hike or climb based on how high up a mountain is though. The difficulty is determined by the incline, or, steepness of the hike up, whether it requires a lot of scrambling and how long the steep inclinations go for.</p>\n<p>You could have a 2,000m mountain with a slight slope that you walk for an hour easily, vs a 100m mountain that has a 50 degree incline that will give you more of a challenge. It&rsquo;s like a slow jog vs <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training\">HIIT</a> training.</p>\n<p>At the top of the mountain, I took the opportunity to enjoy a small break - re-energised myself with some food and prepared myself for the downward section of the mountain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-easy-part\">The Easy Part</h2>\n<p>The walk down was enjoyable. Heart rate back to normal, the sweat on my back cooling me down as the sun rose higher into the skies.</p>\n<p>I made it back in time to get home, have a shower and pick up the girls from school.</p>\n<p>The next fun part of the whole hike was to edit all the footage I took of my video and audio and upload it to my <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/samuellison\">ko-fi</a> account for subscribers to download for free if they wish it (or pay what they like).</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear about your adventures!</p>",

It is a gorge that has been carved out of the rugged landscape by the Lerderderg River.\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/lerderderg-landscape.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Image\" title=\"Lerderderg Gorge\">\r\n\t<figcaption>Photo taken of some of the scenery seen while climbing up the Lerderderg Gorge.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early 1851, the area was reputed to be a hot spot for gold mining, and At its peak saw thousands of diggers arrive looking for the lucrative mineral.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in hiking this beautiful location, you can check out the AllTrails entry here: [https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/australia/victoria/lerderderg-gorge-circuit)\r\n\r\n## The Adventure\r\n\r\nIn this section of the log, I am going to go on and on about my last hike around the Lerderderg Circuit Track. But, if you want to see and hear it first hand instead of read, you can do so by watching this 3.5 hour video of my hike below.\r\n\r\n<iframe title=\"Lerderderg Gorge - March 2025\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://makertube.net/videos/embed/qmE2utucUNLLumbLmKdUAE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n### The Beginning\r\n\r\nI set off early in the morning, but due to the weather known to be cooler, I didn't start my hike in the cool or the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning and I strapped my [DJI Action](https://www.dji.com/au/osmo-action-5-pro) onto my chest to get some Point of View (POV) footage of the entire hike to make a video out of it for those interested. That should be embedded for you above for you to watch. If it doesn't work, let me know in the comments and I will embed from an alternative source!\r\n\r\nI brought a [R0DE VideoMic Pro](https://rode.com/en/microphones/on-camera/videomic-pro) Microphone as well, linked up with [Rode Wireless Pro's](https://rode.com/en/microphones/wireless/wirelesspro) to capture any sounds with some more detail, as that's something I would also like to increase my skills in, and then I set off down the beautiful trail.\r\n\r\nAt this time of the year, there's usually no flowing water along the river, so the river crossings are easier and you can keep your feet dry, but I will say that having flowing water along a majority of the hike sets a beautiful sound and scenery to enjoy alongside you - so I will be returning here with flowing water with this new equipment. My first attempt at recording this location was using my [mobile phone](https://makertube.net/w/pySqnnSGD6dAryQ3fcrHNW) which while the quality was high, it doesn't leave enough room for editing the colours just right to my own liking.\r\n\r\nHere are a few sound recordings that I took along the hike. I hope that you enjoy listening to them as much as I enjoyed the recording of them.\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"112\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 112px;  overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://sounds.familylison.com/@sporetrail/episodes/small-birds-1/embed/dark-transparent\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"112\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 112px;  overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://sounds.familylison.com/@sporetrail/episodes/birds-1/embed/dark-transparent\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"112\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 112px;  overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://sounds.familylison.com/@sporetrail/episodes/cockatoo-1/embed/dark-transparent\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"112\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 112px;  overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https://sounds.familylison.com/@sporetrail/episodes/cockatoo-2/embed/dark-transparent\"></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Difficulties\r\n\r\nThis time around, I felt much fitter than my first attempt. Yes, it was cooler, and that would have helped some, but I also felt my cardiovascular and my fitness in general was up to standard for this hike. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple scrambles which actually require you to use your hands to hold onto the rocks to help yourself up, but nothing too difficult. You just need to be a little careful if you are like me and like to [ruck](https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/) your pack. Basically, I enjoy having a 15kg or more backpack on. Not only due to my requirement for photography equipment, but [rucking](https://www.ruckformiles.com/guides/what-is-rucking/) is also a form of exercise and increases my strength needs when hiking, especially when going up and really getting into those leg muscles. \r\n\r\nGoing down means I have to go slower, and trekking poles are really a necessity, as falls are more likely with a heavier backpack when not careful of the extra weight.\r\n\r\nEven climbing sometimes, it requires you to activate your core muscles more and take notice of your centre of gravity point, as leaning back a little too much, you'll find that you struggle to keep a balance!\r\n\r\nI wish I already had a heart rate monitor and my handheld GPS tracker, as I would like to wear a strap heart rate monitor that tracks my heart rate along the hike, that I can then overlay across the whole video of the hike. That way, you can get a feel of how easy or how difficult a portion of what I am doing might be, based on my own fitness levels - but I am no athlete!\r\n\r\n> A smart watch with built in heart rate wont do it for me. New ones aren't what they use to be, in my opinion, and their privacy policies are all as bad as each other, require proprietary software to read data from which these companies data mine you for. I will give what data I want to publish thanks.\r\n\r\n### The Top\r\n\r\nAt the top of the mountain, I was approximately 440 or 450m above sea level. I wouldn't be grading the difficulty of a hike or climb based on how high up a mountain is though. The difficulty is determined by the incline, or, steepness of the hike up, whether it requires a lot of scrambling and how long the steep inclinations go for. \r\n\r\nYou could have a 2,000m mountain with a slight slope that you walk for an hour easily, vs a 100m mountain that has a 50 degree incline that will give you more of a challenge. It's like a slow jog vs [HIIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training) training.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the mountain, I took the opportunity to enjoy a small break - re-energised myself with some food and prepared myself for the downward section of the mountain.\r\n\r\n## The Easy Part\r\n\r\nThe walk down was enjoyable. Heart rate back to normal, the sweat on my back cooling me down as the sun rose higher into the skies.\r\n\r\nI made it back in time to get home, have a shower and pick up the girls from school.\r\n\r\nThe next fun part of the whole hike was to edit all the footage I took of my video and audio and upload it to my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/samuellison) account for subscribers to download for free if they wish it (or pay what they like).\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear about your adventures!\n",

Allowing people to create their worlds (think, rooms) and connect them to existing grids (think, servers).</p>\n<p>So, not only can you host your own worlds on an existing grid and create an account and personal identity on that grid (or server), but you also have the ability to do it yourself, host your own grid with as many worlds as you wish, and connect it to what is known as the <a href=\"http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid\">Hypergrid</a>, and still be interconnected between all the different worlds, grids and so forth.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at it is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Region</strong> = World, or, Planet</li>\n<li><strong>Grid</strong> = Server, or, Universe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can add a planet to someone else&rsquo;s universe, or you can create your own universe with your own rules and connect it, or not, to the Metaverse, or, Multiverse, officially known as the Hypergrid.</p>\n<p>And it will always be there, no matter what happens to the rest of the universes (grids) out there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-i-do\">What did I do?</h2>\n<p>I decided to host my own Region (or World) and connect it to the Grid (Universe) known as <a href=\"https://www.osgrid.org/\">OSGrid</a> which allows registered users to connect their own regions to their grid, at no cost (besides of course your own hosting costs).</p>\n<p>This means, I used an existing avatar account to make the owner of my region and self-host it!</p>\n<p>By default, region sizes are setup in the OpenSimulator configuration as 256x256 meters (which is also the size of regions on Second Life). It&rsquo;s actually possible to run much larger region sizes, or to host multiple regions together and place them next to each other to suits your needs.</p>\n<p>In my case, I am running a single region, the size of 4x4 (16) regions. Basically, 1024x1024m in land size, and I can do whatever I like with it.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s currently bare though, and here&rsquo;s a screenshot of it in its current state.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"what-am-i-working-on\">What am I working on?</h2>\n<p>I want to build a world based off of 28 Years Later. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3iiyYkKXpxk\">trailer</a> yet, I highly recommend that you do.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of having a city which is going through a Zombie Apocalypse and the player having to fight their way through an infested city by smacking zombie NPCs and gathering resources, until they come across a stranded island that appears to be a safe-haven.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>This safe-haven will be a village with roles for people to take on and to live their merry lives on. Roles might include things like farmers, smiths, carpenters and hunters. Hunters would go out back into the city, looking for valuable resources, such as metals, more foods, ammunition and medicines.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>A fun survival style game.</p>\n<p>How do you accomplish that on the Metaverse? Are you able to code?</p>\n<h3 id=\"yes-you-can-code-on-the-metaverse\">Yes, you can code on the Metaverse!</h3>\n<p>Not only can you build your world with 3d mesh models and materials, in my case, assets I purchased from the <a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/\">Unity Asset Store</a> and converted them into usable formats using <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/\">blender</a>; but you can code anything your heart desires in OpenSimulator (and yes, in Second Life too).</p>\n<p>Both OpenSimulator and Second Life have their own scripting languages.</p>\n<p>Second Life uses the <a href=\"https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal\">Linden Scripting Language (LSL)</a> and OpenSimulator has a highly expanded, yet similar language known as <a href=\"\">OpenSimulator Scripting Language (OSSL)</a>.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of code so you can see how easy it is:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>default {\n    touch_start(integer num) {\n        key player = llDetectedKey(0); // Get the avatar's key\n        string playerName = llDetectedName(0); // Get the avatar's name\n\n        // Send registration request to the data server\n        llRegionSay(12345, &quot;Register|&quot; + (string)player + &quot;|&quot; + playerName);\n\n        // Notify the player directly\n        llSay(0, &quot;Registration request sent, &quot; + playerName + &quot;.&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>You can view more of my source that I have been working on within my <a href=\"https://github.com/TemujinCalidius/SurvivorCore\">GitHub Repository</a>!</p>\n<p>This is just a registration board that players can click on to register their avatar as a player in the system I am working on, but there&rsquo;s way more to do - such as having a HUD and floating text above avatars that tracks the players current survival stats, such as Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Infection as well as a multitude of other things, such as Inventory slots, Coins/Money and so forth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-one-visit\">How does one visit?</h2>\n<p>To visit places on the OpenSimulator metaverse, you need a virtual world viewer.\nAnd you need the version that allows connection to multiple grids and not just the default Second Life proprietary grid.</p>\n<p>The best browser currently is the <a href=\"https://www.firestormviewer.org/\">Firestorm</a> viewer.</p>\n<p>You will need the OpenSimulator version which you can grab from here: <a href=\"https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/\">https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/</a></p>\n<p>There is support for Windows, Mac and Linux versions. I am using Linux and it works fine.</p>\n<p>You can visit my land and come say hello when I am there, by adding the <a href=\"https://www.osgrid.org/\">OSGrid</a> option to your logins (by clicking on &ldquo;<strong>Click to add more grids</strong>&rdquo;, creating an account through the browsers &ldquo;<strong>Create an Account</strong>&rdquo; link and logging in.</p>\n<p>Once you are in, open your world map in the view and search for &ldquo;counterearth&rdquo;. I will probably rename the region later to something that matches the RP game I wish to make and update this article when that is done.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is not much to see in my world currently, but I endeavour to post more updates on my proceedings and discuss the scripts I have come up with in further articles - so be sure to add this RSS to your reader to keep getting updates on my posts!</p>\n<p>I hope that this has also inspired you into looking into the Metaverse and seeing how you could contribute with your coding knowledge to make the experience better for everyone out there! I believe the GitHub repository for OpenSimulator can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/opensim/opensim\">https://github.com/opensim/opensim</a> and is coded in the C# language.</p>\n<p>Have fun all!</p>",

Basically, 1024x1024m in land size, and I can do whatever I like with it.\n\nIt's currently bare though, and here's a screenshot of it in its current state.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"A virtual environment screenshot shows an avatar standing on a platform with boxes scattered nearby, overlooking a landscape and ocean in the distance.\" title=\"Metaverse Screenshot\">\n\t<figcaption>\n\t\tA screenshot of my region on the OSGrid. Nothing much to see yet!\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## What am I working on?\n\nI want to build a world based off of 28 Years Later. If you haven't seen the [trailer](https://youtu.be/3iiyYkKXpxk) yet, I highly recommend that you do.\n\nI love the idea of having a city which is going through a Zombie Apocalypse and the player having to fight their way through an infested city by smacking zombie NPCs and gathering resources, until they come across a stranded island that appears to be a safe-haven.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-03-02-19-46-56.png\" alt=\"A small, lush island surrounded by a vast expanse of ocean is visible through the gaps in the clouds.\" title=\"28 Years Later Island\">\n\t<figcaption>\n\t\tSource: A screenshot taken of the safe island and village from the 28 Years Later trailer.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis safe-haven will be a village with roles for people to take on and to live their merry lives on. Roles might include things like farmers, smiths, carpenters and hunters. Hunters would go out back into the city, looking for valuable resources, such as metals, more foods, ammunition and medicines.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-03-02-19-58-43.png\" alt=\"A display featuring hand-drawn images and a sign reading \"Roles in Our Community\" illustrates various community roles, including hunting and farming.\" title=\"28 Years Later Island - Roles\">\n\t<figcaption>\n\t\tSource: A screenshot taken of some of the available community roles from the 28 Years Later trailer.\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nA fun survival style game.\n\nHow do you accomplish that on the Metaverse? Are you able to code?\n\n### Yes, you can code on the Metaverse!\n\nNot only can you build your world with 3d mesh models and materials, in my case, assets I purchased from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) and converted them into usable formats using [blender](https://www.blender.org/); but you can code anything your heart desires in OpenSimulator (and yes, in Second Life too).\n\nBoth OpenSimulator and Second Life have their own scripting languages.\n\nSecond Life uses the [Linden Scripting Language (LSL)](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal) and OpenSimulator has a highly expanded, yet similar language known as [OpenSimulator Scripting Language (OSSL)]().\n\nHere's a snippet of code so you can see how easy it is:\n```\ndefault {\n    touch_start(integer num) {\n        key player = llDetectedKey(0); // Get the avatar's key\n        string playerName = llDetectedName(0); // Get the avatar's name\n\n        // Send registration request to the data server\n        llRegionSay(12345, \"Register|\" + (string)player + \"|\" + playerName);\n\n        // Notify the player directly\n        llSay(0, \"Registration request sent, \" + playerName + \".\");\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can view more of my source that I have been working on within my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TemujinCalidius/SurvivorCore)!\n\nThis is just a registration board that players can click on to register their avatar as a player in the system I am working on, but there's way more to do - such as having a HUD and floating text above avatars that tracks the players current survival stats, such as Health, Stamina, Hunger, Thirst and Infection as well as a multitude of other things, such as Inventory slots, Coins/Money and so forth.\n\n## How does one visit?\n\nTo visit places on the OpenSimulator metaverse, you need a virtual world viewer. \nAnd you need the version that allows connection to multiple grids and not just the default Second Life proprietary grid.\n\nThe best browser currently is the [Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) viewer.\n\nYou will need the OpenSimulator version which you can grab from here: https://www.firestormviewer.org/os-operating-system/\n\nThere is support for Windows, Mac and Linux versions. I am using Linux and it works fine.\n\nYou can visit my land and come say hello when I am there, by adding the [OSGrid](https://www.osgrid.org/) option to your logins (by clicking on \"**Click to add more grids**\", creating an account through the browsers \"**Create an Account**\" link and logging in.\n\nOnce you are in, open your world map in the view and search for \"counterearth\". I will probably rename the region later to something that matches the RP game I wish to make and update this article when that is done.\n\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-03-02-20-39-55.png\" alt=\"A virtual map interface is displayed on a digital platform with various navigation and search options, showing an avatar's location.\" title=\"OpenSimulator World Map\">\n\t<figcaption>\n\t\tSource: Screenshot of the world map open with counterearth in the search field to find my region for visiting!\n\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much to see in my world currently, but I endeavour to post more updates on my proceedings and discuss the scripts I have come up with in further articles - so be sure to add this RSS to your reader to keep getting updates on my posts!\n\nI hope that this has also inspired you into looking into the Metaverse and seeing how you could contribute with your coding knowledge to make the experience better for everyone out there! I believe the GitHub repository for OpenSimulator can be found here: https://github.com/opensim/opensim and is coded in the C# language.\n\nHave fun all!\n",

Need to make sure to eat the right foods that can provide energy throughout the day, not just simple sugars that give you an hour boost, then all of a sudden, nothing.</p>  <p>I done some major core workouts 2 nights ago with my friend Dean. Over 120 push-ups &amp; 120 sit-ups.</p>  <p>Now I am sitting at home a little bored &amp; wondering what to do whilst waiting on some washing to complete. It’s a little too hot &amp; stuffy to clean the bathroom.</p>  <p>Tonight at 5pm I will be doing some light sparring – that will be fun. And tomorrow, more training and light sparring with Dean.</p>  <p>On other details, I am booking a night out at a vineyard in the Macedon Mountains for Dao &amp; I which should be both relaxing &amp; fun. We have never had the opportunity to have time completely alone with each other since we met more than a year ago now.    <br>We will be out in the country, enjoying the fresh air, a 3 course dinner &amp; breakfast in the morning.</p>  <p>Also I look forward to our time together in Vietnam. Instead of just being with Dao’s family, we will also be spending some time alone at a tourist resort by the finely sanded beach. This will be a whole lot of fun &amp; romantic.</p>  <p>Anyway, I need to look carefully into setting myself up a diet, which will enable me to store plenty of energy to burn throughout the day. Perhaps even gain me another 5kg or so.   <br>I wouldn’t mind hitting 75kg for my height and build.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "Week 1 – Not as Planned",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>My first week of intense training did not go to plan for myself. Point is, I should have known to do more stretching before and after training. I did none - literally. </p>  <p>Now, the thing with this is. When you begin to push your muscles and work on ones that you’ve never really pushed before, if you don’t do stretching, you will feel the ache for days on end after each time your exercise.   <br>So, instead of getting a good full week of training, I got almost 2 days. I couldn’t finish my run on the treadmill as I had planned because of my calves and my right ankle. The ankle has been bad for a couple of weeks since beginning on the jump rope, but I bought some ankle guards to help with that. But on my first day of harder training I went for 3 by 3 minute rounds of skipping with 30 second breaks, on top of treadmill, weights, sparring and cardio; totalling 3 hours in the night. My muscles needed stretching, which I did not do. This put me off training for the rest of the week; argh!</p>  <p>I have 2 weeks off work now; holiday pay. So I’m happy about that. I can focus my mind, relax and concentrate on training properly. It’ll also give me time to relax my mind. Instead of work, train, work, train. I can produce a schedule to ease the mind. I found that with harder training and constantly thinking about fighting, you begin to lose the balance in your mind… something they call Yin Yang?  I felt a build up of testosterone for a while and more eager to get into a fight; more confident, but also to a point I felt I could be more cocky towards peoples attitude. This is something that is a big no for me, and requires that I focus, give myself time to sit down, close my eyes and bring my mind back to Earth. This was not during my first week; this had been building up over my previous 5 months.</p>  <p>Let’s hope next week will prove to be more of a success!</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

				"title": "The Making of a Fighter",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A new Chapter in my life is being made as I write this blog post. And that is ‘<strong>The Making of a Fighter</strong>’.</p>  <p>Those of you who have been keeping up with my blog, know that I have been doing Muay Thai as a sport and as a way to keep myself fit. But I am taking it to the next level, now that the opportunity has been given. I wish to become a Fighter, and get myself on the ring over time with hard training.</p>  <p>I’ve been asking around, and a lot of fighters work full time on top of their training. So really, whether or not you can become a fighter has a lot to do with the right mentality and strength in your mind to motivate yourself to work your 10 hour days and then go straight off to training for a few more hours after that before finally getting home to relax. </p>  <p>I believe I have the mentality and the strength to push myself to train hard and make something of myself. Energy and explosive energy are very much in the mind; I’ve proven that to myself various times. Of course, the right foods also play a very large role in this. it is much like weight training. The three biggest ingredients in life to get where you want always remain: <strong>DIET, TRAINING, SLEEP</strong>. By diet I do not mean a ‘lose weight’ diet. I mean eating the right foods that focus on where you want to go. High carbs to gain weight (of course, high carbs being complex carbs with less chance of storing as ‘fat’), proteins to feed your muscles before and after training and so on.</p>  <p>So, I will start the heavy routine on Monday. Working from 5am till 3-4pm. Doing fight training from 5-6pm. Stopping to feed the body with more energy and doing weight training from 6-7pm. Doing the intermediate training and cardio from 7-8pm and finishing up with some floor work with Karl to do some Jujitsu training or sparring. Hopefully home and in bed by 10pm and ready for the next day of work and stuffing the body full of good foods and energy.</p>  <p>John Scida tells me he can make good fighters (and I’ve seen it). But, I doubt we can make good fighters who haven’t the mentality and strength to push themselves to the limit? You need the right person, the right stock. From my reading on Melbourne’s underworld, I’ve noticed that most if not all of the main figures involved, were fighters in their past; either Muay Thai, Kick Boxing, Boxing and so forth. Why? Is it because that these Men were strong minded? And why were they the way they were? St. Albans and Sunshine is considered a brewing location for fighters. Because they learn to fend for themselves on the street? But it’s also considered a brewing location for the criminals? And why is it that criminals are the ones with the strong mindset to train and become fighters?</p>  <p>Is there a balance between fight training and relaxing the mind and body?</p>  <p>And for great trainers like John Scida. Does it not become disappointing to lose potentially great fighters who’ve trained so hard and well only to be lost to the law system or to be found ten feet under?</p>  <p>I wish to become 1 out of 200 students. I will become 1 out of 200 students. I will work, I will train, I will relax and rest. And I will stay on my side of the fence. That of a life of honour, respect, loyalty. </p>  <p>The new Chapter begins.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Within 15 minutes I arrive and we’re off to bargain on a good laptop. </p>  <p>I spent 4 hours with them setting everything up, the toughest part being the router due to having to get the internet access passwords back and such and making sure it’s well secured from outside users trying to access the wireless options. They have 3 laptops and a PC accessing the router.</p>  <p>8am the next morning I am awakened by a phone call asking if I am home. A bran new lawn mower is awaiting me at my door within the next half hour as a thank you gift for my service to the family. </p>  <p>I guess that will stop me spending money on Jim’s Mowing (check my old posts!) every few weeks to get my lawn done.

By the looks of the thing, it was entering me about 2mm at a time, in and out, really fast. Just imagine the tip of a needle just sitting on your skin and dragging it along your arm slowly and that’s probably as close as you will get to the feeling. I will say that the pain is <em>sudden on</em>  as much as it is <em>sudden off</em>. As soon as the needle hits your skin and gets dragged you feel the slight pain, and as soon as it comes off your skin you are all relaxed again and forget that it was even there. Of course, there are certain spots along the arm with different pain thresholds, such as where you arm bends, opposite your elbow; it’s very fleshy there and probably the only place besides the triceps area where you might grit your teeth or look away a little!</p>  <p>Personally, I think the most painful part for me was actually getting home an hour later having to run the whole thing under warm soapy water. I jumped in the shower. I think it hurt more than the needle in the way that it activates the pain all over the art work, not just in the one spot the needle is entering. It reddens your arm and makes it feel like you just got a massive sunburn and that pain has still stuck with me over night. But nothing that can’t be lived with for the next few days.</p>  <p>Of course, let’s not forget the preparation before the tattoo. They shaved my arm completely clean; not that I had any hairs there to start with! And then they rub your whole arm in dettol and alcohol. As long as you know how to control your mind and forget pain is there, you’ll be fine. They had to rub my arm clean over 4 times to get the stencil right, so my arm was pretty bright red before even starting the ink work.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERp3OjJ6I/AAAAAAAAAEU/TRKsQ5_CztY/s1600-h/P7180067%5B16%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180067\" height=\"233\" alt=\"P7180067\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/25ef83d073.jpg\" width=\"285\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a> So, what exactly is my tattoo about? Well, I wanted to draw a sword on my right arm. Since in today's day and age in our society, we are not permitted to carry a sword; you’ll find yourself arrested. So, how can I carry a sword that means something to me and my past? Ink it! So, I get a sword designed, and I love a beast called a Tarn in a fantasy series I read, which resembles in our world, an Eagle. Except that they are so large that a human can ride on its back and battle it out in the skies. The handle of my sword is designed with two eagle heads facing away from each other. </p>  <p><a href=\"http://lh3.ggpht.com/_H7Dsqx6Wv8Q/SmERsVF8bII/AAAAAAAAAEc/3XasepCATbc/s1600-h/P7180066%5B7%5D.jpg\"><img title=\"P7180066\" height=\"285\" alt=\"P7180066\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/ea4f4edba1.jpg\" width=\"233\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\"></a> Then, I wanted vines and scrolls wrapping the whole sword, so that I could show the meaning of it out to everyone. I put my name on the top, symbolising that it is my sword, and then I put my direct family names down the whole blade. My grandparents on both sides of my family, my mother, father, sister, brother. Should my sword be used (my arm or fist in reality) you will feel the wrath of my whole family. My sword is my honour, it is my life. </p>  <p>Are tattoo’s addictive as the rumour goes? Yes, completely! As much pain as you are going through, they are addictive. I’m already getting my left shoulder designed, which will be a shield; within it my family emblem displaying <em>Lison</em>. And I even have my back design in mind already, but more on that when I get my shield done to match my sword. Don’t want to spoil that post ability!</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Cheers everyone! </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

I’ve picked it up and have booked in to get it done on the 17th of July for the outlining and then on the 31st of July for the shading and what not. </p>  <p>I wonder how much it’ll hurt?</p>  <p>I’ve decided to put my name in the handle scroll and 8 family names from my brother, sister, parents and  grand parents down the blade of the sword which will symbolise my blood and inner power through to my hands/wrists. </p>  <p>It’ll be a 3/4 sleeve design all the way down my right arm. Once this is done I’m getting my family crest designed in tattoo form for my left arm in a shield, and possibly after that a large design on my back which is still sitting in my mind (warrior mounted on a large eagle swooping down with talons open to capture a naked woman in the open fields of grass).</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

Because I don’t! I work 50 hour weeks and by the time I get home or the weekend comes around I’m just too buggered. All I want to do is relax and enjoy the weekend while I can; making the most of it. Much like I am doing now – sitting here relaxing on a Friday afternoon as a very nice bloke from Jim’s Mowing who’s still on business hours works on my front and back yard.</p>  <p>As you can see from the photo I took on the right, it look(ed) quite a mess. Since splitting up with my Ex-Girlfriend and her having still lived here for a while I refused to do all the dirty work; which I think is fair?</p>  <p>Ok, so if I did it in the first place, the grass wouldn’t have gotten this bad and I wouldn’t of had to call in Jim’s Mowing to do the work. But these guys do a good job, and they are good on the price.</p>  <p>My front lawn and back lawn cost a total of $70, including weeding. And if I use them on an ongoing basis it’ll cost $50. I know, I’m lazy and should buy a lawn mower. But for shared accommodation? I think it’s a good set up :)</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samlison/3575496574/\"><img title=\"IMG00021\" height=\"245\" alt=\"IMG00021\" src=\"https://samuellison.com/uploads/2025/c4d006de93.jpg\" width=\"287\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"></a></p>  <p>Wouldn’t you agree? Now all that’s left to do is get my lazy but up and fix those bricks surrounding the trees :D</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>…</p>  <p>Maybe tomorrow.</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

It seems that ever since using my sisters laptop (mind you I can’t wait to get my new one of my own so I can post a whole lot more funner subjects including videos) I’ve become more hooked onto social networking sites.</p>  <p>I’m now connected to Twitter, FaceBook, Blogger (this blog), Windows Live Spaces, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Gmail, Google Reader, Calender and more!</p>  <p>I’m planning on having my main website <a href=\"http://www.samuellison.com\">www.samuellison.com</a> designed by professionals linking to all of these services directly to me. And while I’m getting that done I’m thinking about getting a really nifty personal business card (what else do you call them even if they are not for business use? Contact Card? Social Card?) with personal graphics, logo, website address and mobile phone.     <br>I was thinking my site to be directed to me in online form; having a cartoon character created with me wearing what I do in my real workplace (all whites) but with a laptop and all these techie goodies; making him somewhat cool yet… meaty :P </p>  <p>I’ll get a quote on web design and graphics design. It’ll be one page only with perhaps a contact form to my gmail account or something. We’ll see what I can get done!</p>  <div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-24829348645671267?l=samlison.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",

There were not many innovative designs or new models; probably because last years models or before, for many of the companies, are still unsold and sitting around collecting dust? <p>Anyway, I took a few photos of the usual sports cars we see there, including my favourite lotus :P and only my favourite because lotus use  the exact same engine that is in my Toyota.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/8214267339603030296-5809036281476976125?l=samlison.blogspot.com\" alt=\"\"></div>\n",
