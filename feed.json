It's built on the principles of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\"), emphasizing personal domain control, content ownership, and interoperability with other web services.\n\n<!--more-->\n<figure>\n\t<img src=\"uploads/2025/screenshot-from-2025-02-10-15-55-20.png\" alt=\"A watercolor painting of tree trunks against a light blue background. Overlaid on the image are several quotes in white text boxes: 1. 'The social network you can feel good about.' — Annie Mueller 2. 'Micro.blog is a place where 'users' can become people again. It's social at the speed of human.' — Greg Moore 3. 'Micro.blog gave me a frictionless way to do what I always wanted to do: put my thoughts and feelings out there on my own blog.' — Gabriel Santiago 4. 'Slower paced, quieter and thus less demanding on one's attention. It's not about chasing likes or followers, or posting quick takes.' — Paul Robert Lloyd 5. 'Micro.blog is not an alternative silo; instead, it's what you build when you believe that the web itself is the great social network.' — Brent Simmons\" title=\"Micro.blog Quotes\">  \n\t<figcaption>Voices of the Community: Quotes from Micro.blog users reflecting on the platform's impact on personal blogging and community interaction.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## **The Creator:**\n\n- **[Manton Reece](https://www.manton.org/ \"Manton Reece\")** is the mind behind [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\"). With a background in software development and a passion for reviving the personal blogging culture, Manton has crafted [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") since its inception through a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing \"Micro.Blog Kickstarter Campaign\") campaign in 2017. His vision was to create a space where blogging feels like tweeting but retains the essence of personal web ownership.\n\n## **IndieWeb Practices:**\n\n[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") actively incorporates several [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\") practices:\n\n- **Own Your Content:** Users are encouraged to use their own domain names. The service supports mapping your personal domain to your [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") account, ensuring you maintain control over your digital identity.\n\n- **POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere):** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") facilitates posting from your own site and syndicating to various platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/ \"Mastodon\"), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app \"BlueSky\"), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com \"LinkedIn\"), and others, automatically, thereby keeping your content under your control while still reaching broader audiences.\n\n- **Webmentions, Micropub, and IndieAuth:** These [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\") standards are supported, allowing for rich interactions across the web, where comments or likes from one site can be reflected on another.\n\n- **ActivityPub:** Part of the Fediverse, [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") uses [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/ \"ActivityPub\") for federation, allowing your posts to interact with users on other compatible platforms.\n\n## **Subscription Model:**\n\n- [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") operates on a **freemium model**. The basic plan starts at just **$1 per month**, which includes:\n  - Your own blog with unlimited posts\n  - Your own domain name\n  - Podcast hosting\n\nMore advanced features like automatic cross-posting, video hosting, and enhanced cross-posting capabilities are available in higher tiers.\n\n## **Freedom and Flexibility:**\n\n- **Domain Use:** Users are not locked into [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\"). You can use your own domain, ensuring that if you decide to leave, your content and URL identity remain with you.\n\n- **Backup Options:** \n  - **Automatic GitHub Backup:** Your blog can be backed up to a GitHub repository automatically, providing a secure, version-controlled backup of all your posts.\n  - **Internet Archive:** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") also offers periodic backups to the Internet Archive for long-term digital preservation.\n\n- **Export Formats:**\n  - **Hugo Format:** [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ \"Hugo\") as its static site generator, which means all content can be exported in this format. This includes your posts in Markdown, theme files, and configuration, allowing for a seamless transition if you decide to self-host or move to another platform.\n  - Additionally, exports can be done in JSON, Markdown, and other blog archive formats, ensuring your data is never trapped.\n\n## **Why Hugo Format?**\n\nI recommend sticking with the Hugo format for several reasons:\n\n  - **Portability:** Hugo is well-regarded in the static site generation community, making it easy to find hosting or move to another service.\n  - **Maintainability:** With all posts in Markdown, editing or updating content post-export is straightforward.\n  - **Theme Customization:** The theme files allow you to maintain the look and feel of your blog even if you switch platforms.\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") stands out as a service that not only promotes but practically implements [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/\"IndieWeb\") principles, offering a platform where blogging feels intimate yet expansive. Its commitment to user freedom, with easy data portability and the encouragement of personal domain use, makes it an excellent choice for those who value their digital independence. Whether you're a seasoned blogger or just starting, [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog \"Micro.Blog\") offers a way to engage with the web that feels authentic and owned by you.\n\n<meta name=\"fediverse:creator\" content=\"@samuel@social.familylison.com\">\n",
